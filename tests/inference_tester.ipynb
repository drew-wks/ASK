At the 2014 Auxiliary National Convention (NACON) in Orlando, FL in August, the following \\nrecommendations were placed before the National Board for vote.  They are summarized with the Chief \\nDirector\\'s final determinations below:  \\n \\nA. Recommendation: Amend CG Auxiliary Manual (AuxMan, COMDTINST M16790.1 (series)) \\nsection 4.G.5. \"Simultaneous Offices\" to add language that prohibits holding the Finance or \\nMaterials staf f offices while concurrently holding any elected office at the same organizational \\nlevel (e.g., an Auxiliarist cannot concurrently serve as FC/VFC and FSO -FN or FSO -MA).  \\nProvisions are also proposed in the event there is no effective way for the unit to c omply with this \\nprohibition.  Submitted by DCOs D1 -NR, D1 -SR, D8 -CR, D8 -WR, D9 -WR, D11 -NR, and D11 -\\nSR via DNACO LANT -E.  \\n \\n(1) National Board vote:  For, after minor amendment.  \\n \\n(2) Chief Director final action:  Concur and approved.  Final policy language will be \\ndeveloped with the National Executive Committee, announced by ALAUX, and \\nmemorialized in the next change to the AuxMan. Changes to AUXDATA will also have to \\nbe made.  \\n \\nB. Recommendation: Establish an Auxiliary Musician Specialist (AUXMU) program co nsisting of \\ncertified musicians to be used in various public affairs events and venues of note.  Certified \\nmusicians would meet prescribed qualifications and would encompass all music categories in the \\nAuxiliary Skills Bank.  The leader should be a certifi ed musician and be assigned as a Branch \\nChief in the Community Relations Division of the Public Affairs Directorate.  Establishment of \\nthis specialty will facilitate an excellent public affairs and recruiting tool for the Coast Guard \\nAuxiliary and the Coas t Guard.  This recommendation will utilize musician skills sets obtained \\noutside the Auxiliary and not add to any training cost for the Auxiliary.  Submitted by DCOs D1 -\\nSR, D8 -CR, and D11 -SR via NACO.  \\n \\n(1) National Board vote:   For.  \\n \\n(2) Chief Director f inal action:   Concur and approved.  This competency will enhance \\nAuxiliary public outreach and image, and there is a clear parallel with the CG Musician\\'s \\nrating.  Accordingly, there must be dialogue with the CG music program to address \\nperformance standar ds, expectations, policies, etc.  Final policy language will be developed \\nwith the National Executive Committee, announced by ALAUX, and memorialized in the \\nnext change to the AuxMan.  Changes to AUXDATA will also have to be made.  \\n \\nC. Recommendation: Repl ace the current option for documenting eligibility for an Anniversary \\nStreamer, when the original charter cannot be located, from providing, \"...a listing of all previously \\nserving Flotilla Commanders for the 50 -year period...\" to \"...a letter from the DIR AUX \\nAuthenticating Eligibility for the Award.\"  Submitted by DIR -H via NACO.  \\n \\n(1) National Board vote:  For.  \\n '),\n",
