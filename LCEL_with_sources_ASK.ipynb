Eligibility \\nIntroduction The Auxiliary is an organiza tion of uniformed volunteers.  Pursuant to \\nprovisions of this chapter, m embership is open to any citizen of the U.S. and \\nits territories and possessions who is seventeen years of age or older. \\nMembership is predicated on successful completion of the Auxiliary \\nenrollment application (including the passing of the New Member Exam), \\nand receipt of  a favorable (FAV) Personnel Secu rity Investigation (PSI) in \\naccordance with the Personnel Security and Suitability Program Manual, \\nCOMDTINST M5520.12 (series), and pa ragraph C.3 of this chapter . \\nIndividuals who hold dual citizenship w ith the U.S. and another country may \\nbecome members of the Auxiliary.  Such  individuals whose other country of \\ncitizenship is one of those specifica lly identified in Table 2.C of the \\nPersonnel Security and Suitabil ity Program Manual, COMDTINST \\nM5520.12 (series), will not be authorized  to pursue a Direct Informational \\n(DI) or Direct Operational (DO) PSI nor  any of its associated activities.  \\nSimilarly, an Auxiliarist who holds dual citizenship and who pursues a DI or \\nDO PSI must clearly indicate in their DI or DO PSI package the willingness \\nto renounce their other country ’s citizenship if circumstances dictate.  Failure \\nto so indicate will be recognized by the Director  a s  s u f f i c i e n t  g r o u n d s  t o  \\nimmediately terminate the DI or DO PSI process. \\nAuxiliary membership is open to all U.S. citizens, or those of dual \\ncitizenship as described above, who are current military active duty or \\nReserve personnel, or veterans of thes e services who were discharged under \\nhonorable conditions (see secti on 3.A.6 of this Manual). \\nFacility (vessel, aircraft, or radio st ation) ownership and special skills are \\ndesirable, but not mandatory for membership. \\nA.1.  Facility \\nDefinition A facility is a privately owned boat, yacht, personal watercraft, aircraft, fixed \\nland, or land mobile radio station, at least 25 percent of which is owned by \\nthe Auxiliarist.  Under certain conditions, the Director may grant a waiver \\nfor corporate or government owned facilitie s.  All surface facilities, however, \\nmust meet the requirements stated for vessels in the Auxiliary Operations \\nPolicy Manual, COMDTINST M16798.3 (series); the  Vessel Examiner \\nManual, COMDTINST M16796.2 (series); and local requirements \\nestablished by the District Commander.  For aircraft or radio facilities, the \\nrequirements are in the Auxiliary Op erations Policy Manual, COMDTINST \\nM16798.3 (series).  To become a faci lity it must meet applicable \\nrequirements, be offered for use,  and be accepted by the Director. \\n3-3 '),\n",

The course concludes with a \"piloting problem\" which makes  \\n  practical application of all the topics learned in the course. \\n \\n         In addition to these regular courses, the Auxiliary provides a  \\n  special short lecture program on boating safety for schools, churches,  \\n  or other organizations.  All public education is given by qualified  \\n  Auxiliary instructors, many of whom have had years of experience on the \\n  water, and all of whom are well acquainted with the subjects they teach. \\n \\n         The Courtesy Marine Examination program is the second basic  \\n  \"cornerstone\" activity of the Auxiliary.  These safety equipment checks  \\n  are provided as a free public service, performed at the request of the  \\n  boat owner or operator.  The annual \"Seal of safety\" decal indicates \\n  that at the time of the examination the boat not only met federal  \\n  regulations and safety-related equipment requirements of the state in  \\n  which the examination was conducted--but also satisfied initial Auxiliary  \\n  requirements that may go considerably further in some cases.  The \\n  examination is, in effect, a \"one-on-one\" educational program involving a \\n  valuable exchange of boating safety information.  These examinations are  \\n  conducted by specially qualified Auxiliarists who have been trained as  \\n  Courtesy Examiners. \\n \\n         Each year, the Auxiliary\\'s operational activities help thousands  \\n  of recreational boaters who find themselves in trouble.  Auxiliarists  \\n  cooperate with the Coast Guard and State boating officials to augment  \\n  their forces for search and rescue missions, safety patrols, and regatta \\n  patrols. \\n \\n         Another of the Auxiliary\\'s programs is Project AIM, Academy  \\n  Introduction Mission.  Annually since 1955, Coast Guard Auxiliary units  \\n  throughout the country have sponsored a visit to the Coast Guard Academy  \\n  for selected high school students.  The visit is 5 days in length with \\n  meals, lodging and transportation provided to the students, many of whom \\n  compete for appointment as a Coast Guard cadet subsequent to their visit.   \\n  This program has been successful in promoting interest in, and desirable  \\n  publicity for, the Coast Guard and its Academy. \\n \\n         RAP, Recruitment Assistance Program, is another cooperative  \\n  Auxiliary effort to aid in the Coast Guard\\'s procurement of officers and  \\n  enlisted personnel. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nENC 1-6 '),\n",

ACRONYMS/ABBREVIATIONS \\n1. What in the world is an AUXOP, DCDR, or FSO-?  One of the first puzzles for a new \\nmember is the shorthand (acronyms/abbreviations) with which we sprinkle our \\nconversations and writing.  It\\'s the \"insider\" Auxiliary language, just like other insider \\nlanguages.  Acronyms are a part of the game.  Don\\'t become frustrated; no one knows \\nthem all.  Ask a fellow Auxiliarist or look them up in your Auxiliary Manual or on \\nthe Auxiliary website at: www.cgaux.org. \\n2.  Some helpful examples:  \\n• PE—Public Education \\n• VSC—Vessel Safety Check \\n• OP—Operations \\n• MT—Member Training \\n• BS&S—Boating Skills & Seamanship \\nE. MEMBER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER \\nYou have been given an Member Identification Number.  From this point on, your status, \\nactivities and accomplishments will be recorded in the Auxiliary Data Syste m \\n(AUXDATA) using that number.  The Coast Guard has provided you with an Identification Card.  Your Member ID is provided on your card. It is important that you \\nknow and understand your Member ID.  \\nF. DUES \\nEach year you will receive a notice when dues are pay able.  Your total dues are divided \\ninto four parts: flotilla, division, district, and national.  You pay your total to the flotilla. \\nThe Flotilla Finance Officer (FSO -FN), in turn, sends the appropriate portions of your \\ndues to the other levels of the organization.  Our dues help to support Auxiliary activities at all levels of the organization and are tax deductible.  \\nG. REPORTING \\nThe status, qualifications, and activities of all members and units in the Auxiliary are \\ntracked in the Auxiliary Data System (AUX DATA) using the member number.  Since the \\nAuxiliary plays a significant part in Coast Guard accomplishments, it has a direct bearing on Coast Guard funding.  Reporting is very important to you, your flotilla and division \\nand the Coast Guard.'),\n",

Liability insurance protects the Auxiliarist from third -party claims made as a \\nresult of actions that occur when the Auxiliarist is performing authorized missions an d \\nhas been properly assigned to duty.  \\n \\nIn order to maintain this coverage, all incidents and accidents must be reported to your \\norder-issuing authority for the mission.  As a caution, there must be strict adherence to all \\nCoast Guard governing policies, or the claim may be denied.  \\nD. EXCHANGE PRIVILEGES  Auxiliarists in uniform, with proper identification, can purchase anything sold in the Coast Guard Exchange System (CGES) Stores except \\nliquor and cigarettes.  Family members may accompany Auxiliarists to th e Exchange, but \\nmay not make individual purchases.  Members of the Auxiliary are also welcome at other Department of Defense Exchanges, but only uniform items or accessories may be \\npurchased. \\nE. PUBLICATIONS  Members receive the quarterly Auxiliary National p ublication, The \\nNavigator, their own district/division/flotilla publications, and other bulletins to keep \\nabreast of Coast Guard, Auxiliary, and general boating information.  \\nF. UNIFORMS AND AWARDS  The pride of wearing the Auxiliary uniform is amplified by awards and advancement.  There are ample opportunities to receive recognition by \\ncompleting Auxiliary training courses and participating in authorized programs.  \\nG. TAX DEDUCTIONS  Uniforms, their cleaning and maintenance, and reasonable out -of-\\npocket expenses incurred in the performance of your duties are considered contributions \\nfor tax purposes.  The foregoing is not intended to be advice on deductibility. You should \\nconsult your professional tax advisor. \\n \\nDoing something useful with friends may be the benefit that will bring satisfaction to your \\nmembership.  That could mean tossing a towline to a distressed boater, or tossing a salad at a \\nflotilla picnic.  It could mean being a student or an instructor, checking a boat or performing an \\nexam, using computer skills or accounting skills ... it could mean a lot o\\nf things.  \\nIT IS UP TO YOU ... a little or a lot, once a month or once a day—something that interests you and \"as your time and circumstances permit. \"  The personal benefits and satisfaction that you recei ve from your membership will depend upon your choice and level of participation.  \\n \\nWELCOME ABOARD!

Task Structure  Below is an  example : \\nBCM -07-05-AUX  \\n     Indicated that the task must be accomplished on an Auxiliary \\nfacility .  \\n   Task designation number.  The task is a knowledge or skill objective to be performed.   \\n  Division designation number   \\n Qualification  designation  (e.g., BCM = Boat Crewmember ; COX N = Coxswain; \\nPWC = Personal Watercraft ).  \\nA.3. Task Completion \\nRequirement  All tasks shall be completed unless specifically stated otherwise.  Certain tasks \\nin the Qualification Guide are designated as “ Waiverable Tasks  by \\nDIRAUX”.  The Director may waive these designated tasks on a case- by-case \\nbasis given the mission requirements, the nature of the waters, or if the task is \\nnot operationally required for the geographical area. Any tasks that is either \\ndetermined to be “Waiverable Tasks  by DIRAUX” , Not Applicable (N/A), \\nor as applicable require appropriate comments in the “Comments” section for \\nthat specific “TASK”.  \\nA.4. Deferred Tasks  When situations exist that preclude a member from completing qualification \\ntasks outside of “ Waiverable Tasks  by DIRAUX” or Not Applicable (N/A) , \\nthe mentor may defer those tasks. The decision to defer a  task should not be \\ntaken lightly. Deferment applies to a member s inability to complete a task due \\nto equipment and/or facility  constraints.  Deferred Tasks r equire ap propriate \\ncomments in the “Comments” section for that specific “TASK”.  \\nNOTE \\uf024  \\nMembers moving to a new location  or with multiple residences , previously \\n“Waiverable Tasks by DIRAUX ”, Not Applicable (N/A), or Deferred Task  must be \\nreconsidered for completion based on new location and facility capabilities before \\nrecertification.

An MA Task Order Form should be used to detail specific operational \\nactivities, such as task lo cations, mission requirements, personnel information, etc.  The \\ntask order shall be consider ed supporting documentation and forwarded for inclusion in \\nthe reimbursement package. \\n6. Under some circumstances, Coast Guard uni ts may be tasked under another agency’s \\nMA.  For example, the EPA can accept a MA for hazmat response disaster wide and then generate a task order for the USCG to actually conduct a portion of the operation.  \\nAwareness of this task order shall be comm unicated to the operational commander for \\nthat specific area of responsib ility the correspondi ng Headquarters, Area , and/or regional \\nliaison officers (LNO) responsible fo r processing the task order. \\nC. Execution\\n.  When executing a MA, the Coast Guard will  adhere to a number of expectations.  \\nFirst, the Coast Guard must use its own f unds and resources to procure the goods and \\nservices needed to complete the assigned ta sking.  Second, the AO should closely monitor \\nthe implementation of the project, ensuring that  goods and services are delivered on time and \\nwithin the budget outlined for the MA.  The Coast Guard will only be reimbursed for work \\nperformed within the statement of  work and projected timeline.  If the Coast Guard or FEMA \\nrecognizes the need to increase or decrease th e obligated funding amount, this issue will be \\nbrought to the attention of the AO, FEMA PO , and the MA Manager so the MA can be \\namended.  Completing work outside of the scope  of work and/or projected timeline, or \\nexceeding obligated funding may prevent reimbursement to the Coast Guard unit assigned to perform the MA.  Finally, the Coast Guard must make all payments to government or private \\nvendors used in the event for all incurred costs.  In the event that probl ems arise that prevent \\nor inhibit the Coast Guard from  executing the assigned MA as originally intended, the FEMA \\nPO will work with the MA Manager to amend or de-obligate the original MA based on the \\nnewly developed plan.  MAs may also be cancell ed when the activity is no longer required \\nbecause the need has been met through other means. \\n1. Requests to amend an existing MA must be submitted via a RRF to the FEMA PO or MA \\nManager.  MA amendments are only made fo r changes in the cost ceiling, period of \\nperformance, or the assigned FEMA PO.  Under no circumstances should an amendment \\nbe done to change the statement of work, to include added or removing task orders.  If a \\nchange in the statement of work is necessary, a new MA must be drafted.  Therefore, in a \\nlarge disaster, a broad statement of work for an MA is preferred to many small, detailed, \\nstatements of work. \\n2. Each distinct source of funding for an MA provided to the Coast Guard must have its \\nown unique accounting string in the Coast Guar d accounting system.  An amendment that \\ndoes not change the MA number (or the re lated FEMA account line) does not require a \\nnew Coast Guard accounting string. \\nD. Reimbursement.\\n  Refer to Reference (w), Section 5.1.8 “FEMA Reimbursable Agreements” \\nfor reimbursement billing requirements. '),\n",
