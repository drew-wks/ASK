At civilian, military, and Auxiliary ceremonies and events that are clearly military \\nservice -centric in nature (e.g., military changes of command; Auxiliary changes of watch; \\nmilitary and Auxiliary retirements; Coast Guard Foundation dinners; local community \\nbanquets in honor of military services; patriotic parades on national holidays; funerals of \\nmilitary veterans and Auxiliarists) and which require a unifor m. Auxiliarists who do not own \\nDinner Dress Blue Jacket or Dinner Dress White Jacket may wear Service Dress Blue  “Bravo”  \\n(or Service Dress Blue “Alpha ” as may be prescribed) to such ceremonies and events for \\nwhich such formal wear is prescribed.  \\n \\n     b.  Service Dress Blue  “Bravo,”  Service Dress Blue “Alpha, ” or Service Dress White may \\nbe worn when prescribed for military personnel. However, Service Dress White is only \\nauthorized for wear by past and present District Commodores, past and present members of \\nthe National Executive Committee (NEXCOM), and Auxiliarists who are currently certified in \\nthe Auxiliary Chaplain Support (ACS) program when it is the prescribed uniform for the \\nceremony or event in which they have been invited to participate.  \\n \\n     c.  Social or other functions when the invitation has been clearly influenced by military \\nservice (e.g., an Auxiliarist who has been invited to be part of a bridal party for a military \\nbride and/or groom may wear Service Dress White only if it is the prescribed uniform and the \\nAuxiliarist is authorized to wear that uniform as authorized above).  \\n \\n     d.  If an Auxiliarist does not possess any of the aforementioned uniforms , then they may \\nwear the Blue Blazer outfit or civilian wear comparable for such events (e.g., personal gown; \\npersonal tuxedo).  \\n \\ne.  The Uniform Regulations, COMDTINST M1020.6 (series , CIM link ), authorize retired \\nCoast Guard personnel to wear the dress uniform that was prescribed at the time of their \\nretirement, or any dress uniform that is currently authorized for military personnel, to certain \\nformal and ceremonial events. The same holds true  for Auxiliarists in retired status. Such \\nevents include:  \\n \\n(1)   Military ceremonies (e.g., retirements; changes of command; funerals).  \\n \\n(2)   Patriotic parades on national holidays or occasions in which military personnel are \\ntaking part.  \\n \\n(3)  Social or other functions when the invitation has been influenced by the Auxiliarist’s \\nprior military service.  \\n \\nf.
