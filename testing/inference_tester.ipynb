Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment \\nIntroduction The Coast Guard is committed to a workplace where no member of the \\nworkforce will be subject to physical or  verbal harassment, abuse, violence, \\nor discrimination based on an individual’s race, colo r, religion, sex, sexual \\norientation, national origin, age, disabi lity, marital status , parental status, \\npolitical affiliation, or  a n y  o t h e r  b a s i s  p r o t e c t e d by law.  Simply, it is \\ncommitted to an environment free of harassing and discriminatory behavior. \\nHarassment is generally defined as  u n w e l c o m e d  a d v a n c e s ,  r e q u e s t s  f o r  \\nfavors, and other physical and verbal conduct when such conduct explicitly \\nor implicitly affects an individual’s employment, unreasonably interferes \\nwith an individual’s service performan ce, or creates an intimidating, hostile, \\nor offensive environment.  This also encompasses unwelcome display or \\ncommunication of sexually offensive materials. \\nB.1.  \\nResponsibilities The Coast Guard and Auxiliary must  h a v e  p e o p l e  w h o  s e r v e  t o g e t h e r  \\neffectively to accomplish missions and are responsible for enabling and \\nensuring this for each of its members.  \\nB.1.a.  Fair \\nTreatment All persons are entitled to be treated fa irly and with dignity and respect.  All \\nmust be allowed to serve and to enjoy an environment free of unlawful \\ndiscrimination and harassment. \\nB.1.b.  Adverse \\nEffects of \\nHarassment The economic costs of harassment are si gnificant.  Even more harmful are \\nthe negative effects of harassment on productivity and readiness.  These \\nareas include increased absenteeism,  g r e a t e r  p e r s o n n e l  t u r n o v e r ,  l o w e r  \\nmorale, and decreased effectiveness.  Adverse actions also result in a loss of \\npersonal, organizational, and public trus t.  While not easy to quantify, these \\ncosts are real and seriously affect the Coast Guard and Auxiliary’s ability to \\naccomplish missions.  \\nB.1.c.  \\nPrevention \\nThrough \\nLeadership and \\nCommitment The key to preventing harassment is pe rsonal leadership and commitment.  \\nThose who serve in Auxiliary leader ship and staff positions must commit \\nthemselves to constantly and consiste ntly promoting equitable treatment.  \\nAuxiliary leaders must convey this commitment clearly and unequivocally \\nto all Auxiliarist s by holding themselves and their Auxiliarist s accountable.  \\nThere must be firm determination to use these tools judiciously and in \\ntimely fashion in meeting the Commandant ’s goals as stated in this chapter.  \\n7-9 '),\n",

Reporting Sexual Harassment . Sexual harassment is a serious issue and every supervisor \\nand Commander has an obligation to take action when made aware of a problem.  When \\nsexual harassment has occurred or is taking place the person experiencing harassment can choose to confront the harasser.  However, if the person is uncomfortable confronting the \\nharasser , or the situation is so severe that it is dangerous or unreasonable to do so, the \\nperson should immediate ly bring the matter to the attention of a supervisor or CO/OIC in \\nprivate.  If the supervisor is the alleged harasser, the harassment should be reported to the next higher level in the chain of command. Additionally, at any point, individuals experiencing harassment or retaliation have the right to initiate an EEO/EO complaint or \\nseek guidance from a servicing CRSP. \\n10. Acts of Retaliation . Acts of retaliation for reporting prohibited harassment or \\nparticipating in an investigation is prohibited.  If anyone feels that they are being \\nretaliated against or punished or suffering negative consequences as an employee of the Coast Guard because of the fact that they experienced, reported or attempted to stop or prevent harassment, they may also file a complaint regarding the retaliation issue. See \\nChapter 5 of this Manual for details on the process of filing complaints. \\n11. Responsibilities of the CO/OIC , Managers, and Supervisors . CO/OIC, managers, and \\nsupervisors are required to follow the steps outlined in the Harassment Complaint Procedures in this chapter when they become aware or are notified of sexual harassment \\nallegations.  The CO/OIC, Managers, and Supervisors should be sure that their conduct sets an example and is not such that they may be vulnerable to claims of sexual harassment. \\n12. Knowledge and Recording . All levels of leadership need to maintain accountability for \\nthe behavior of their subordinates.  Leaders and supervisors who fail to recognize acts of sexual harassment and take appropriate action are not performing the responsibilities and duties of their position.  Leadership must be knowledgeable of sexual harassment prevention policies and must take appropriate administrative and/or disciplinary action once harassment is reported .  The CO/OIC , Managers, and Supervisors must ensure that \\nall unit personnel receive SHP training each year. \\nJ. Whistleblower Protection . Retaliation or harassment of an employee or applicant for \\nemployment because he or she discloses information that is reasonably believed to evidence violations of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety is prohibited.  This applies unless disclosure of such information is specifically prohibited by law and such information is specifically required to be kept secret by executive order in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.  Civilian personnel who believe that they are subjected to whistleblower retaliation may file a complaint with the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) or the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC).  Military members who believe they are subjected to whistleblower retaliation may file a complaint with the DHS OIG, but not the U.S. OSC.  The website for the DHS O IG for whistleblowers seeking \\nassistance is: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/whistleblower -protection. The U.S. OSC’s website \\nfor filing a complaint is: https://osc.gov/pages/file -complaint.aspx. \\n3-22 '),\n",

Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to prescribe procedures, in accordance with the \\nEEOC and DHS Anti -Harassmen t policies, for preventing harassment in the S ervice and \\nto promptly correct any harassment that occurs .  This policy also prescribes additional \\nnotification procedures for conduct that could constitute a potential hate incident and \\nguidance for determinin g and addressing the occurrence of a hate incident. However, this \\npolicy is not designed to make a legal determination that unlawful harassment has occurred or grant relief to individuals who allege they have been subjected to harassment. \\n6. Responsibility: Civil R ights Directorate ( COMDT CG-00H) staff, Commanding \\nOfficers /Officers in Charge (CO/OIC) , Deputy and Assistant Commandants for \\nDirectorates , and the Judge Advocate General ( TJAG) must ensure compliance with the \\nprovisions of this policy. COMDT CG-00H is only responsible for providing guidance \\non the Coast Guard Anti-Harassment and Hate Incident policy and collecting and maintaining data. The command is responsible for carrying out the policy discussed below. \\n7. Acts of Retaliation .  Acts of retaliation or reprisal for reporting harassment or \\nparticipating in an investigation of harassment are prohibited. If a member believes he or \\nshe is subjected to retaliation/ repris al for participating in complaint activity, they may \\nalso file a complaint regarding the retaliation or reprisal issue.  See Chapter 5 of this \\nManual for details on the process of filing complaints. \\nD.  Defining  Unlawful Harassment and  Prohibited Harassment  \\n1. Unlawful Harassment : Unlawful harassment is discrimination that violates federal law .  \\nUnlawful harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, \\nnonverbal, or physica l, that is based on an individual’ s protected status (including : race, \\ncolor, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, status as a parent, marital status, political affiliation, and retaliation ) and is so objectively offensive as to \\nalter the victim’s conditions of employment.  \\na. Examples of unwelcome conduct include: offensive jokes, epithets, slurs, \\nstereotyping, name calling, mockery, intimidating or demeaning acts, and the \\ncirculation or posting of written or graphic materials that show hostility toward individuals because of their protected status.  \\nb. This standard is met when the conduct results in a tangible employment action or a hostile work environment. \\n(1) Tangible employment action harassment is a type of harassment in which the \\nharassment by a supervisor or manager results in a personnel action.  A tangible employment action must be an official action, such as hiring, firing, promotion or failure to promote, demotion, undesirable assignment, significant change in \\n3-7 ')],\n",
