**Introduction**


In the rapidly evolving maritime landscape, the U.S. Coast Guard's mission is expanding, demanding a more agile and informed Auxiliary. This document helps address that challenge by introducing ASK (Auxiliary Source for Knowledge), a state-of-the-art knowledge management system. Harnessing the power of Generative AI Document Search, ASK aims to streamline access to information, so Auxiliary members can quickly get answers to questions from authoritative sources in a user-friendly way. This proposal delves into ASK, its potential benefits and role in bolstering the Auxiliary's support for the Coast Guard's changing needs.


**The Evolving Mission of the USCG**


The U.S. Coast Guard stands as a global leader in maritime services, ensuring the safety, security, and care of our Nation's waters. It wears many hats: a military service, a law enforcement agency, a first responder, a regulator, and an intelligence community member. Our nation's prosperity and security are deeply tied to the sea, and the Coast Guard is at the forefront of this connection.


The Coast Guard's mission set is changing and expanding in response to growing requirements posed by rapid advancements in technology, an evolving geopolitical landscape, emerging uses of the maritime environment, space and cyber domains, and increasing impacts of natural disasters and climate change. This growth brings along challenges in manpower, budget, and resources.


**The Auxiliary's Need for Evolution**


The Coast Guard leans on the USCG Auxiliary and its volunteers to fulfill its strategy and mission. But the Auxiliary is at a pivotal moment. To stay relevant, it must adapt to the Coast Guard's changing needs.


Recent years have seen the Auxiliary take on new missions and update how it conducts existing ones. Examples include the AUXCYBER initiative (2022), Auxiliary Chaplain Support (2020), and the Cyber Flotilla (2023). There's also been a noticeable growth in Emergency Management, Auxiliary Student Programs, and AUXPAD.


The way we execute missions is changing too. We're seeing higher standards, more tasks, better integration with Coast Guard systems, and a move towards digital training. The updates to MSAM and Surface Operations are clear signs of this shift.


All these changes mean that our team needs to stay updated with new policies and skills.


**Facing Knowledge Management Hurdles**


The Auxiliary needs to update how it shares information, especially considering the growing amount of data and the digital preferences of the younger generation. To achieve this, we need a solution that offers quick, precise, and user-friendly access to trusted knowledge sources.


The Auxiliary faces the daunting task of efficiently managing an ever-increasing amount of information. It's crucial for our members to have timely, accurate, and well-formatted data to remain effective in their roles.


Currently, our primary information sources are PDF documents. However, there's a noticeable lag between their release and their actual use. To address this, DIRAUX frequently issues BSX Policy Memos and ALAUXs. This adds to the volume of documents our team must navigate.


It's clear: the number of policies, documents, and guidelines is at an all-time high. Accessing these resources is not straightforward. They're dispersed throughout various sections of the USCG and Auxiliary online platforms, complicating the search for definitive answers.


The absence of a unified document system poses risks. Relying on outdated information can lead to errors. Moreover, the complexity of accessing these resources can be discouraging, especially for newcomers. This could dampen morale and even result in members departing.


Our future hinges on our adaptability, particularly in the digital realm. To remain pertinent, we must cater to the tech-savvy younger members. This involves reimagining how we present information, emphasizing efficiency, accuracy, and ease of use.


In essence, the Auxiliary must modernize its information-sharing approach, keeping in mind the vast data influx and the tech inclinations of newer generations. Our goal is to introduce a system that ensures swift, accurate, and straightforward access to reliable information.


**How an AI-powered Knowledge System Can Help**


Unstructured data such as pdfs and emails accounts for 80% of all the data  within organizations


# 1
. The reference and policy information Auxiliarists's need to carry out their missions is stored as PDFs. this type of data. Manuals, Alcoast emails, Workshop info is all unstructured data. And, like most organizations, the Auxiliary's repository of this information is constantly growing.


Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) has ushered in groundbreaking innovations in knowledge management. Knowledge systems based on Gen AI Document Search offer three important human performance advantages: efficiency, accuracy, and an improved user experience by combining the powerful information retrieval of a search engine with the text generation of AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT.


**Generative AI Document Search**


Generative AI Document Search brings together two capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI): the powerful information **retrieval** of a search engine with **text generation** ability of a Generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT operating within a controlled organizational environment.


Generative AI Document Search overcomes limitations of both by utilizing retrieved information from existing data, ensuring that the answers provided are not only contextually appropriate but also substantiated by credible sources.


G ![](RackMultipart20231103-1-8l1lch_html_dbb106003fd43594.png) enerative AI Document Search process works by taking a user's question from a search bar, it first retrieves related information from a pre-defined library of USCG reference documents, and then generates a detailed response back to the user that includes the source citations.


**Not a Chatbot**


Generative AI Document Search is not a chatbot like ChatGPT. Off-the-shelf chatbots such as ChatGPT area versatile, but as a result, they are not naturally suited to all applications. In contrast, Generative AI Document Search systems are designed to do one thing: retrieve and summarize information. Chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google BARD suffer from several significant drawbacks that limit their application in organizations. For instance, they aren't trained on Auxiliary information. They do not understand that common words such as "task", "division", or even "auxiliary" have specific meanings in the Auxiliary. They don't understand authority and answer questions at all costs, whether they "know" the answer or not.


Generative AI Document Search doesn't suffer from these drawbacks because it is based on the organization's own internal information. That allows it to respond with a high level of accuracy and quality.


**Benefits of Generative AI Document Search for the Auxiliary**


Generative AI Document Search presents an innovative opportunity to create a human performance advantage for the Auxiliary as it evolves to support the US Coast Guard.
