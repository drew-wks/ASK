 **How does ASK stay up to date?  
Each year, The Coast Guard suspends policies and replaces policies with new ones. ASK keeps all documents in a central repository that is managed by an Auxiliarst. This person is responsible for tracking new policy and updating the library to ensure it has the most recent national policy available. If you see a document missing from the libary or should be removed, please send an email to uscgaux.drew@wks.us.
