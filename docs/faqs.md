** How does ASK stay up to date?** 
 Each year, new documents are released that suspend old guidance. Outdated documents must be replaced with new ones. ASK keeps all documents in a central repository that is managed by an Auxiliarst. This person is responsible for tracking new policy and updating the library to ensure it has the most recent national policy available.
