Identification as affiliated with the C oast Guard may be as a result of past site \\nactivity, photos of themselves, or other indirect activity. Even when off-duty, and on a personal site or blog, Coast Guard military personnel are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and civilian employees are subject to administrative or legal action if they violate policy or security regulations.  \\n \\nb.  All Coast Guard personnel are responsible for any statements, comments, or blogs posted \\nunder their name. Personnel are not shielded from legal action for libel or other violations of the personal rights of others.  \\n \\nc.  Auxiliarists  are subject to  and abide by Coast  Guard  policy. Auxiliary  social  media  \\npolic ies effectively  align  with those for other Coast  Guard  personnel. \\n \\nd.  Section 5.R. of reference (a)  addresses Auxiliary s ocial m edia policy. It states  whether in \\na personal capacity or assigned to duty, Auxiliarists are expected to ensure their use of \\nsocial media , \"…neither  inadvertently nor deliberately connects or a ssociates, or projects \\nan image of connection or association with, inappropriate material that is not consistent \\nwith the Coast Guard\\'s C ore V alues and Ethos.\"  \\n \\ne.  There are various other rules  and responsibilities  that come with  official  or unofficial use \\nof social  media  as an Auxiliarist. We must be vigilant in  acting  professionally online at  \\nall times.  Auxiliarists  must always consider how their posts will reflect upon the Coast \\nGuard, the Auxiliary, and themselves. \\n \\nf.  You  can assume  anything posted is  public. Even  if your personal Facebook  timeline  is set \\nto \"friends  only,\" there is  still an  audience.  If you affiliate as an Auxiliar ist \\non social  media  in any fashion, including images,  video, text,  comments , or past  online \\nactivity,  you must act  accordingly and  respectfully.  \\n \\n \\n \\n ', 'metadata': {'source': './test_pdfs_copies_delete_after_use/USCGAUX_Social_Media_SOP_FINAL_ESIGNED_12JUN23.pdf', 'page': 15, 'title': 'AUXILIARY SOCIAL MEDIA STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES', 'pdf_id': '31fba5d9-53a8-5d3c-81cc-358d15f0b6e4', 'publication_number': None, 'organization': 'CG-BSX', 'scope': '1_national', 'issue_date': '2023-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'upsert_date': '2024-11-14T19:45:30Z', 'expiration_date': '2033-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'aux_specific': True, 'public_release': True, 'embedding': 'text-embedding-ada-002', 'page_count': 34}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

For regulations pertaining to uniform wear, consult \\nChapter 10 of reference (a)  or an Auxiliary Human Resources staff officer . \\n \\n(2)  Each page manager  and their respective leadership  is responsible for what is  post ed - \\nshared and  original content!  \\n \\n(3)  Follow ethics of journalism when posting on social media. Traditional ethics still \\napply.  \\n \\n(4)  Verify there  are no copyright infringements. In regard to  imaging  or other intellectual \\nproperty, include credit and/or source. Do not use non-government al images  or other \\nintellectual property  without expressed written  permission  from the original creator . \\nCiting a source does not equal permission. When in doubt, err on the side of caution \\nand do not post it. Consult with unit leadership or experienced PAO for further \\ninquiry. Just because another official  page has posted an image or authored text , \\ndoes not mean it is authorized to use or share.  \\n \\n(5)  Do not post new  information or news about Coast Guard units on your Auxiliary \\nFacebook page without first clearing it with the active duty PAO and Officer- in-\\nCharge or Commanding Officer for that unit. It is permissible and encouraged to \\nshare from Coast Guard unit pages using the share function, since the content is \\nalready  vetted .  \\n \\n(6)  Only  share from  Coast Guard, Coast  Guard  Auxiliary, or other official  government \\npages.  Do not share from unofficial pages, private accounts, commercial pages, or \\nnon-profit entities not directly related  to the Coast Guard or Auxiliary. There are \\nexceptions when working with non-governmental agencies and other entities. \\nExceptions require approval from the D SO-PA and DCO, via COLM . When you \\nhave a question about sharing from an unauthorized page, first get g uidance from a \\nknowledgeable PAO or unit commander trained in public a ffairs.   \\n \\n(7)  On Auxiliary Facebook pages, it is preferable and courteous to utilize the share \\nfunction from Coast Guard and Coast Guard Auxiliary social media pages, instead of \\ncopying and pasting content that another member took time to create . This is simple \\nsocial media etiquette. There are exceptions, such as the inability to share across \\nplatforms. If you copy and paste content, always name the source page, tag them,  \\nand include photo credit.  \\n ', 'metadata': {'source': './test_pdfs_copies_delete_after_use/USCGAUX_Social_Media_SOP_FINAL_ESIGNED_12JUN23.pdf', 'page': 16, 'title': 'AUXILIARY SOCIAL MEDIA STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES', 'pdf_id': '31fba5d9-53a8-5d3c-81cc-358d15f0b6e4', 'publication_number': None, 'organization': 'CG-BSX', 'scope': '1_national', 'issue_date': '2023-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'upsert_date': '2024-11-14T19:45:30Z', 'expiration_date': '2033-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'aux_specific': True, 'public_release': True, 'embedding': 'text-embedding-ada-002', 'page_count': 34}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

Social Media Security . \\n \\n\"All personnel have a responsibility to ensure that sensitive information is not posted.\" \\nSection 6.E.4. of reference (b)  \\n \\na. Whether  on official  or unofficial  social  media  pages , security  awareness  involving social  \\nmedia  platforms  and posts takes top priority  to help  protect  the safety  of Team  Coast  \\nGuard  members  and operations. The  use of social  media  exposes us to  increasing  digital \\nrisks  and challenges.  Criminal and foreign adversaries have been known to scour \\nplatforms and accounts for the purpose of gathering information, making us more \\nvulnerable. \\n \\nb. Even though Coast Guard Pu blic Affairs policy states, \"Maximum disclosure  with \\nminimum delay,\" take the time necessary to ensure information is suitable for social \\nmedia release. Ensure the post content is accurate and does not violate policy or privacy.   \\n \\nc. If posting images of or from active -duty units or facilities, the O fficer-In-C harge (OINC) \\nor Commanding O fficer  (CO), via their chain of command, must approve the use of such \\nimages or information in any and all media. They are the information release authority.  \\n \\nd. You are expected  to properly  secure your accounts  and carefully  follow Operations  \\nSecurity  (OPSEC),  Security, Accuracy, Policy, and Propriety (SAPP), Controlled \\nUnclassified Information (CUI), and Privacy Act of 1974 restrictions.  \\n \\ne. Never release information  on social media that violates OPSEC or national security. Do  \\nnot post operations information  on an  official  page or your personal timeline  when  \\nactively  engaged  in those operations. That  would be an  example of an  OPSEC  violation  \\nand could jeopardize the safety of members and operations.  \\n \\nf. Be vigilant protecting yourself, fellow  members , and family.  Adversaries  collect  \\nintelligence  via social  media.  Do not tag  yourself or  other members  on an official  Coast  \\nGuard  or Auxiliary  social  media  post/page, and  do not share social  media  posts from  \\npersonal timelines  to an official  page.  Both situations lead  to an individual\\'s private \\ntimeline , potentially  reve aling personally identifiable information (PII ). It can also \\ndirectly  identif y the military  affiliation  of a member  to anyone on the internet. If there is  \\nopen (public) information on the member\\'s  personal  timeline,  names and  photos of family  \\nmembers  and resident  locations can  be exposed.  \\n \\ng. The disclosure of personal information on official  social media  is subject to the \\nprovisions contained in the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act, with certain \\nexceptions, prohibits the disclosure, distribution, dissemination, or copying of any \\ninformation  containing home addresses, home telephone numbers, spouses’ names, \\nSocial Security numbers, and other personal information.   \\n \\nh. Follow SAPP restrictions when posting. It is  helpful to determine if certain information \\ncan be released via social media.

You can create a Twitter account \\nfor your unit at  district level, or above. Posts, named  \"tweets ,\" are limited to 280 \\ncharacters and may include links and images . You can create new content or  \\nshare posts. Sharing a post is called \" retweeting. \"  Similar to Facebook, you can \\nreceive likes and comments on your posts. \\n \\n(b)  Unlike Facebook, where you sign in to  your personal account to get to the \\nAuxiliary page, Twitter is different. You do not create a personal account. \\nCreate a page using the Auxiliary unit’s name as the account name.  \\n \\n(12)  Creating an Instagram Account. \\n \\n(a)  Instagram is a photo, video, and story sharing site owned by Facebook. You can \\ncreate an Instagram account for your unit.  An option is to share your high-\\nquality  photos and proper captioning with the  administrator of the National U.S.  \\nCoast Guard Auxiliary Instagram page .  \\n \\n(b)  To create an Instagram account for your unit, you do not need to open a \\npersonal account. Like Twitter, it can be managed  as a multi-user account if \\nthere is more than one admin istrator . Instagram used to be a mobile-only \\nplatform, but you can now access limited features of  Instagram on a desktop \\nenvironment. Create a unit email for login credentials.  \\n \\n(c)  For more informat ion about setting up an account, visit the Instagram help  \\npage.  \\n \\n(d)  Districts seeking to create YouTube accounts should reach out to the Auxiliary \\nPublic Affairs Directorate’s Social Media Division (DVC -AF) with  any \\nquestions or requests for assistance.  \\n \\ni.  Social Media Statistics . \\n \\n(1)  Statistical insights  and analytics can be found on most social media sites including \\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Page and audience data are gathered \\nand analyzed to determine demographics, audience growth, and content success. \\n \\n(2)  Measuring the performance of activity helps us reach goals and report statistical \\nsuccess to leadership. Data is automatically created by audience demographics, along \\nwith page likes, post likes, post comments, shares, and similar data .

It is important to regularly  post on your social media page. Consistent posting is crucial to \\ngain an audience and attract interest. If you are having a difficult time creating original \\ncontent, share interesting content from other Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, and \\ngovernment pages which may have pertinent information. The National Safe Boating \\nCouncil and Safe Boating Campaign  websites  are excellent resources for downloadable \\nand usable safe boating content for creating social media  posts. \\n \\nf.  The following instructions are general information for creating social media pages , though \\nthere is more than one method. Social media platforms change periodically, so these \\ninstructions can quickly become outdated. Alternatively, y ou can do an internet search for \\ninstructions . Sample search criteria might include, \"How to create a Twitter page in 202 3.\" \\nIt helps to designate the year or you may get old instructions. T he most accurate method is \\nto use the help feature on the platform of choice. \\n \\ng.  Also, since platform features  often change, it is best to visit the platform to decide what \\npage features you want to utilize.  \\n \\nh.  The  Social  Media Creation  Process . \\n \\n(1)  Request  and obtain unit leadership  and DSO- PA approval before  creating  a page for \\nyour unit.  \\n \\n(2)  Report previously created pages through your public a ffairs program leadership up to \\nthe DSO -PA. \\n \\n(3)  Conduct a thorough search  for old pages  before  creating  a new  one. If your unit \\nalready  has a page or account in  its name,  make every  effort  to contact  the \\nadministrator  to take over the page before creating  a new  one. In some instances,  you \\ncan claim  the page via platform  guidelines, but it is  difficult to  accomplish.  Do not \\ncreate a new page,  until the old page is  in your control. \\n \\n(4)  Maintain  brand identity  across  channels.  Consistent naming of social  media  pages  \\nwill exist  nationwide. Social  media  pages  are an official  representation  of the Coast  \\nGuard  and the Auxiliary.  \\n \\n(5)  Do  not use nicknames  or informal  names.  Begin  the page name with U.S.  Coast  \\nGuard  Auxiliary  followed by your unit name.  Never  use the name U.S.  Coast Guard  \\nAuxiliary  alone.  That  name  is reserved  for and assigned  to the main  national  social  \\nmedia  page . If using unit numbers, start  with  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Auxiliary, add a \\nlocation  (as listed  in the Auxiliary  Directory ), then unit number if  desired.  Unit \\nnumbers are not required  (e.g., “ U.S. Coast  Guard  Auxiliary  Flotilla  Vancouver  \\nWA” and  “U.S. Coast  Guard  Auxiliary  Thirteenth District”) . Do not use a f lotilla  or \\ndivision  number alone as  there is  sometimes  more  than  one unit assigned  the same \\nnumber in  different  states , plus the general  public does not know the meaning  of unit \\nnumbers. \\n ', 'metadata': {'source': './test_pdfs_copies_delete_after_use/USCGAUX_Social_Media_SOP_FINAL_ESIGNED_12JUN23.pdf', 'page': 20, 'title': 'AUXILIARY SOCIAL MEDIA STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES', 'pdf_id': '31fba5d9-53a8-5d3c-81cc-358d15f0b6e4', 'publication_number': None, 'organization': 'CG-BSX', 'scope': '1_national', 'issue_date': '2023-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'upsert_date': '2024-11-14T19:45:30Z', 'expiration_date': '2033-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'aux_specific': True, 'public_release': True, 'embedding': 'text-embedding-ada-002', 'page_count': 34}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

Do not \\nengage in controversial discourse in the comment section of posts on Auxiliary or \\nCoast Guard social media pages. Do not speculate or offer controversial commentary  \\non official accounts .

Comments must be \\nmoderated daily and checked frequently when a new post is made. Sometimes the \\nnature of a post will trigger more commenting. Comment threads can quickly spiral \\noff topic when not moderated. When removing inappropriate comments, do not \\ndelete the comment. Use the hide option instead so a record  of the comment is \\nmaintained. If a comment cannot be hidden, take a screenshot, and delete.  Provide \\nthe screenshot and circumstances to DSO -PA, who will save the record . \\n \\n(13)  When engaging with comments on your page, do so in a professional, positive, and  \\nfactual manner. It is okay not to respond to every comment. Feel free to ‘ like’ \\nappropriate comments. Response from the page admin often encourages more \\nengagement.  \\n \\n(14)  The following Coast Gu ard Auxiliary comment policy will be posted on all \\nAuxiliary  social media sites.

Groups can be set to public, private, or secret.  \\n \\n(17)  Units are welcome to create groups for discussion, but membership will be limited  \\nto Auxiliary and  Coast Guard personnel and set to private since posting is done by \\nnamed individuals. Even if it is a private group, all posts should be considered \\npublic and adhere to the posting policy.  \\n \\n(18)  It is  worth  repeating  that it is the responsibility of each  member  to understand the \\ndifference between  official,  unofficial, and  personal  use of social  media  while  \\nengaging online. \\n \\n(a)  Official .  The communication is your job. \\n \\n(b)  Unofficial .  The communication relates to your job regardless of when or where \\nyou write it.  \\n \\n(c)  Personal .  The communication is about personal issues and not related to your \\njob. When  in doubt about social  media  guidelines and policy, check  with  your \\nunit PAO and  experienced  leadership.  \\n \\n5.  Creating  a Social  Media Presence.  \\n \\na.  The social media sites authorized  by the Auxiliary are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and \\nYouTube, with our highest presence (by far) on Facebook. The Auxiliary Photo Corps \\nuses Flick r as a photo repository. \\n \\nb.  Unlike traditional Auxiliary web  sites , social  media is not static. We have conversations \\nwith and get immediate feedback from our stakeholders in the form of likes, comments, \\nretweets , and other digital engagement .  \\n \\nc.  Social media sites offer detailed page statistics, giving us insight to help gro w and market \\nour pages. The more visitors  and followers we have, the more we can succeed in sharing \\nour number one mission and message of Recreational Boating Safety.  \\n \\nd.  Video production and viewing has grown exponentially on social media and is the most \\npopular content. Facebook offers video hosting and live video feeds. You can also share a \\nvideo from YouTube to a social media page. The importance of creating video content \\ncannot be emphasized enough since during the next few years, it will continue to grow as \\nthe primary content on social media . \\n ', 'metadata': {'source': './test_pdfs_copies_delete_after_use/USCGAUX_Social_Media_SOP_FINAL_ESIGNED_12JUN23.pdf', 'page': 19, 'title': 'AUXILIARY SOCIAL MEDIA STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES', 'pdf_id': '31fba5d9-53a8-5d3c-81cc-358d15f0b6e4', 'publication_number': None, 'organization': 'CG-BSX', 'scope': '1_national', 'issue_date': '2023-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'upsert_date': '2024-11-14T19:45:30Z', 'expiration_date': '2033-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'aux_specific': True, 'public_release': True, 'embedding': 'text-embedding-ada-002', 'page_count': 34}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

Introduction to Social Media.  \\na.  What is Social Media? \\n \\n(1)  The Department of Homeland Security defines social media as  the sphere of \\nwebsites, applications, and web-based tools that connect users to engage in dialogue, share information and media, collaborate, and interact. Social media take many different forms, including but not limited to web-based communities and hosted services, social networking sites, video and photo sharing sites, blogs, virtual worlds, social bookmarking, and other emerging technologies. \\n \\n(2)  Social  media  provides an  avenue to  bridge time  and distance to  facilitate  \\ncommunications among people with  various backgrounds and  geographic locations.  \\nIt has become an integral part of our everyday  life and is an in valuable \\ncommunication tool in the 21st century .   \\n \\n(3)  Over  80 percent  of Americans use social media, with the majority on a daily basis. In \\n2023, it was  reported there were  over 4.9 billion active users globally. This was an \\nexponential and phenomenal increase from 2005 when modern- day social media \\nusage was only about seven percent  of the population (Pew Research Center) . \\n \\nb.  Social  Media and  the Coast  Guard  Auxiliary  \\n \\n(1)  Social  media , which  falls under Coast  Guard  public affairs  program  management , \\ngreatly  enhances our ability to  tell the Coast  Guard  and Coast  Guard  Auxiliary \\nstories via text,  imagery,  graphics, and  video. It is used as an avenue to  connect  with  \\nthe boating public and  disseminate  valuable content in  several  mission  areas . \\nAlthough Auxiliary  units are not required  to have a social  media  presence, unlike \\nmost websites,  social  media  is dynamic and  immediate . It allows  two-way, \\nsynchronous communication , and  feedback  with  our stakeholders in  an \\nunprecedented  fashion. \\n \\n(2)  With  the benefit  of adding social  media  to the public affairs  toolkit, we  also have the \\nresponsibility  to understand the guidelines and  ramifications .

Geotagging is the process of adding \\ngeographical identification metadata to various media such as a photograph or \\nvideo, websites, SMS messages, QR Codes. It may reveal a location that should not \\nbe revealed, creating an OPSEC concern.    \\n \\n3.  Managing Social Media. \\n \\na.  Official Auxiliary  social  media  pages  potentially  have a worldwide  audience and are \\nexposed to  public scrutiny  more  than  ever . We  need  to present  content and  responses in  a \\nprofessional manner, reflecting  our core values  and command  messages.  Thus, those \\ninvolved in  using this  very  public medium need  to be trained  in the discipline  of Auxiliary  \\npublic a ffairs  coupled with  social  media  knowledge and  experience.  \\n \\nb.  Social  media  management  is often  more  complex  than  many  realize.  Unit commanders  \\nmust take into  account  resources  and training  when  considering a social  media  presence.  \\nOnly create a social media page if you have trained  Auxiliary staff to manage and \\nmonitor it on a consistent basis. \\n \\nc.  Unit leaders must include social media management during periods of unit leadership \\ntransition. Consider :  \\n \\n(1)  S taffing . \\n \\n(2)  Staff turnover. \\n \\n(3)  Familiarizing new staff/leaders with existing pages. \\n \\n(4)  Assessing c onsistent administration and  monitoring of pages. \\n \\n(5)  Optimizing effectiveness of your social media presence. \\n \\n(6)  Adding administrators  and providing logins to new staff/leader s while  removing \\nprevious staff. Change passwords.        \\n \\nd.  If an  Auxiliary  unit at  any organizational level  within  a district/region  creates  a social  \\nmedia  account of any  sort, then  the District Commodores shall  appoint an  Assistant  \\nDistrict Staff  Officer for Public Affairs  - Social  Media (ADSO- PA-SM) to help  manage \\nand monitor such  social  media  accounts. An  ADSO- PA-SM must be well -versed  on \\nCoast  Guard  and Auxiliary  social  media  policy and  guidelines, and  not be the DSO- PA.  \\n', 'metadata': {'source': './test_pdfs_copies_delete_after_use/USCGAUX_Social_Media_SOP_FINAL_ESIGNED_12JUN23.pdf', 'page': 10, 'title': 'AUXILIARY SOCIAL MEDIA STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES', 'pdf_id': '31fba5d9-53a8-5d3c-81cc-358d15f0b6e4', 'publication_number': None, 'organization': 'CG-BSX', 'scope': '1_national', 'issue_date': '2023-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'upsert_date': '2024-11-14T19:45:30Z', 'expiration_date': '2033-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'aux_specific': True, 'public_release': True, 'embedding': 'text-embedding-ada-002', 'page_count': 34}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

A personal profile and timeli ne are a place \\non Facebook where you can share information (e.g, photos, videos) about \\nyourself. Note that u sing generic or fake identities on  Facebook to create an \\naccount  is a violation of their Terms of Service. If you use a unit name as a \\nprivate timeline na me (which is common practice), you are at risk of having the \\npersonal account removed, which could put the page at risk.  \\n \\n(b)  Reference (b)  guidance is to  not disguise, impersonate , or misrepresent who \\nyou are online. \\n \\n(c)  If you do not al ready have a personal account, you can create an account on \\neither your computer or via the mobile Facebook application on your \\nsmartphone (e.g., android or iPhone). Be aware not  all Facebook features or \\nfunctions work on mobile. \\n \\n(d)  Know the difference between pages and groups. For an official Facebook \\nAuxiliary page, use the \\'page\\' format not the \\'group\\' format. The two \\nformats  have different features and purposes. A \\'page\\' platform is public and \\nallows brands and organizations to introduce their services and activities with a \\nmore professional fact -based method. When someone on Facebook likes or \\nfollows a page, they can start viewing page updates in the newsfeed. A group is a community -based feature that gathers people with the same interests to discuss \\ntopics and share their opinions. Discussions are also welcome on Auxiliary pages if they fall within the guidelines of comment policy. Pages statistically \\nyield better results in search engines since all the text is public.  \\n ', 'metadata': {'source': './test_pdfs_copies_delete_after_use/USCGAUX_Social_Media_SOP_FINAL_ESIGNED_12JUN23.pdf', 'page': 21, 'title': 'AUXILIARY SOCIAL MEDIA STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES', 'pdf_id': '31fba5d9-53a8-5d3c-81cc-358d15f0b6e4', 'publication_number': None, 'organization': 'CG-BSX', 'scope': '1_national', 'issue_date': '2023-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'upsert_date': '2024-11-14T19:45:30Z', 'expiration_date': '2033-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'aux_specific': True, 'public_release': True, 'embedding': 'text-embedding-ada-002', 'page_count': 34}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

If you have been compromised, change your password immediately \\nand verify  engagement of the two -factor authentication  process.  You can also \\nrequest alerts about unrecognized logins.   \\n \\n(8)  Due  to identi ty theft  and other online threats,  be cognizant of privacy  settings  on your \\npersonal accounts too, and  mak e your personal pages more  secure via privacy  setting  \\nadjustments .

On Facebook, \\nyou can  create custom lists  of people and  set your individual posts accordingly. Do  \\nnot use your personal timeline  to officially  conduct Auxiliary  business or disputes.  \\n \\n(11)  It is fine to share official  Auxiliary  posts to  your personal timeline  or account . In \\nthis case,  it is recommended  to keep  the shared  post to  a \"friends  only\" setting . If \\nyou do not maintain  that privacy  setting,  anyone can see a list of share d names  on \\nthe original post and  can click  on names, going directly  to personal timeline s, and  to \\nthe timelines  of anyone who has liked  or commented  on your public post.  \\n \\n(12)  Fake personal or business accounts  (cloning).  Search your social media on a routine \\nbasis for accounts impersonating you or your page. These cloned accounts are \\nusually created  for the purpose of criminal activity. Report these pages  or timelines  \\nto the respective platform.  \\n \\n(13)  Use  caution  opening messages  or comments  sent to Auxiliary  or personal  pages  that \\ncontain  video or links. If you have opened  a message,  do not click  on the video or \\nlink since these are sometimes  used  to spread  malware and viruses. \\n \\n(14)  Unmonitored or abandoned Auxiliary  social  media  accounts can  be the  target  of \\nhackers,  who can potentially  and fraudulently post messages  under the Auxiliary  \\nname.

In the case of Facebook, \\na person utilizes a personal account to create an Auxiliary page. So, if the personal Face book account is compromised, the official Auxiliary account can also be \\ncompromised.  \\n \\n(2)  Secure personal and Auxiliary accounts by utilizing complex and unusual passwords. \\nChoose a strong password, which typically  includes numbers, symbols, and upper \\nand lowercase letters. Avoid  family names, pet names, birth or anniversary dates, \\ncommon words, or other easy -to-hack passwords. Change your password on a \\nroutine basis and do not use the same or similar passwords for different accounts. Do not share your password with anyone and keep your passwords in a secure location.  \\nIf any page administrators change , change the password.  \\n (3)  Use a unique unit email for your Auxiliary  social media account, so if your Auxiliary \\naccount is compromised, personal information will not be exposed. For official \\nAuxiliary accounts, such as Twitter or Instagram, a unit email is required . This will \\nsimplify sharing login information amongst multiple administrators . This will not \\nwork for Auxiliary Facebook  pages , which require a personal account to access a \\nFacebook page as an administrator.  \\n \\n(4)  Many platforms have two -factor  authentication ( e.g., Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , \\nGoogle ) for logging in or recovering an account. Make your accounts secure by \\nadjusting security settings for each platform , and ut ilize two -factor authentication . \\n \\n \\n', 'metadata': {'source': './test_pdfs_copies_delete_after_use/USCGAUX_Social_Media_SOP_FINAL_ESIGNED_12JUN23.pdf', 'page': 8, 'title': 'AUXILIARY SOCIAL MEDIA STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES', 'pdf_id': '31fba5d9-53a8-5d3c-81cc-358d15f0b6e4', 'publication_number': None, 'organization': 'CG-BSX', 'scope': '1_national', 'issue_date': '2023-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'upsert_date': '2024-11-14T19:45:30Z', 'expiration_date': '2033-06-12T00:00:00Z', 'aux_specific': True, 'public_release': True, 'embedding': 'text-embedding-ada-002', 'page_count': 34}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",
