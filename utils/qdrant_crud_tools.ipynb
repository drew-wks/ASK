Operator Uninspected Towing Vessels (OUTV).    \\nThe Coast Guard's authority to issue licenses for Operators of Uninspected Towing Vessels \\n(OUTV) can be found under Title 46 U.S.C. 7101.  Title 46 U.S.C. 8904 requires licensed operators aboard all commercial vessels of 26 or more feet in length engaged or intending to engage in the act of towing.  The only exception are vessels of less than 200 gross tons enga ged in the mineral and oil industry and having offshore mineral and oil industry sites or \\nequipment as their ultimate destination or place of departure.  When on the high seas, OUTVs are limited to vessels less than 200 gross tons.  This is to conform with  the Officers' \\nCompetency Certificates Convention, 1936, 46 U.S.C. 8304, which requires vessels of 200 gross tons or more on the high seas (seaward of the Boundary Line) be manned by licensed masters and mates.  \\n \\n1. Background On Routes.    \\nWhen the OUTV licens e was originated in 1973 there were five general routes:  oceans, \\noceans not more than 200 miles offshore, inland, Great Lakes, and Western Rivers.  The routes were compatible with the four different sets of navigation rules in effect at the time:  COLREGS , Inland, Great Lakes, and Western Rivers.  Applicants had to be examined on \\nthe rules applicable to each route.  Except for the ocean routes each route was separate with no route being superior to another.  Applicants qualifying for ocean routes also qualified for inland waters without showing 90 additional days on inland waters.  \\nExperience on ocean routes would necessarily include service on inland waters since ocean voyages would begin and end on inland waters.  When the inland navigation rules were lat er applied to all inland waters including Great Lakes and Western Rivers, the \\nCoast Guard determined that the route for inland waters should include Western Rivers and Great Lakes.  \\n \\n2. Current Routes.    \\nOUTV licenses are issued with the following routes.  Each route includes all the routes listed below it.  Although masters and mates may have routes for Western Rivers, rivers other than Western Rivers, or (all) rivers, these route descriptions are not the ones that apply to OUTV.  The route descriptions to be used for OUTV are prescribed by 46 CFR 10.464(b) and are listed below. OCMIs should use the routes listed.  Limited local routes should be used when an applicant requests or when an applicant's experience is so limited that a limited route is necessary  \\n \\na. Oceans (domestic trade) waters;  \\n b. Near coastal waters;  \\n \\nc. Great Lakes and inland waters;  \\n \\nd. Western Rivers; and  \\n e. Limited local area designated by the OCMI.  \\n   \"}, vector=None),\n",

However, four groups \\n          were created solely to support the national response mechanism by \\n          augmenting the OSC's staff and providing specialized pollution response \\n          expertise.  They are the NSF, the ERT, the SSC's, and the PIAT.

OSC's are encouraged to use the NSF \\n              whenever its expertise or equipment is needed, or to augment the OSC's \\n              staff when it is overburdened by a response to a given incident.

The NSF should be used when: \\n  \\n              (1)  A medium or major discharge has occurred; \\n  \\n              (2)  Control of the discharge requires the special knowledge or \\n                   special equipment of the NSF; \\n  \\n              (3)  Response will require in excess of 2 days to complete removal \\n                   operations, and augmentation by NSF personnel will release local \\n                   forces to return to normal operations; or \\n  \\n              (4)  In the judgment of the OSC, NSF capabilities are necessary. \\n  \\n              The NSF is also available to assist state and local governments, \\n              provided that such assistance does not interfere with supporting \\n              federal OSC's or other federal agencies.  Additionally, the NSF Dive \\n              Team, a subunit of the Atlantic Strike Team, can assist the OSC by: \\n              conducting underwater investigations and evaluations; serving as an \\n              advisor to the OSC when commercial or U.S. Navy divers and salvors are \\n              used; and performing light salvage or diving operations to control a \\n              pollution source when other divers are not immediately available.

The basic organization of a district command \\n          is outlined in the Coast Guard Organization Manual, COMDTINST \\n          M5400.7.  The district commander, as the principal \\n          representative of the Commandant, is responsible for the support \\n          of units under his command.  He is specifically charged with \\n          ensuring that Coast Guard duties are performed efficiently, \\n          safely, and economically within his district.  In the \\n          performance of his duties, the district commander is assisted by \\n          administrative and technical advisors in those areas in which \\n          they are qualified.  The marine safety division is the staff \\n          component that administers the CVS and PES/MER/WWM Programs at \\n          the district level.  Port safety stations (PSSTA\\'s), marine \\n          inspection offices (MIO\\'s), and MSO\\'s are generally district \\n          units.  In addition, some bases, groups, and stations have \\n          commanding officers (CO\\'s) designated as COTP\\'s. \\n \\n      3.  Marine Safety Officer (MSO) .  Figure 1-3 shows the prescribed \\n          organization of a typical MSO and the type of functional \\n          alignment desired.  Sufficient flexibility is permitted for \\n          local command option and considerations of unit size.  To the \\n          extent practicable, MSO CO\\'s shall utilize this organizational \\n          structure for their individual commands. \\n \\n      4.  Marine Safety Detachment (MSD) .  When there is a need to \\n          provide marine safety services at a remote location, an MSD may \\n          be established upon the submittal of a planning proposal by the \\n          district commander and its approval by the Commandant.  This \\n          review process is required because personnel at an MSD perform \\n          combined functions of the OCMI/COTP/on-scene coordinator (OSC). \\n          The MSD supervisor, equivalent to that of a unit department \\n          head, acts under the supervision of the CO of the \"parent\" MSO, \\n           and exercises OCMI/COTP/OSC powers in the zone in which the MSD \\n          is located. \\n      5.  Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) .  A VTS can be a separate unit, a \\n          subunit, or part of an MSO\\'s port operations department.  It \\n          their own CO\\'s. \\n           provides VTS within a defined area.  Separate VTS units have \\n      6.  National Strike Force (NSF) .  The Coast Guard NSF is one of \\n          the special forces available to assist OSC\\'s in carrying out \\n          pollution response functions.  The NSF, comprised of the \\n           Pacific, Gulf, and Atlantic Strike Teams and NSF Dive Team, is \\n          under the operational and administrative control of the \\n          respective area commander.  Each strike team has a CO and \\n          responds to OSC requests for assistance within a defined area. \\n          When responding to a spill, members are under the operational \\n          control of the OSC.  See volume VI of this manual for \\n          information on the administrative and operational requirements \\n          of the NSF. \\n     7.  Marine Inspection Office (MIO) .  An MIO is headed by a CO who \\n         is also designated as an OCMI.  An MIO\\'s organizational pattern \\n         and workload are similar to that of an MSO, except that the port \\n         operations department and COTP functions do not exist.  Due to \\n         managerial considerations at several major U.S. ports, some MIO\\'s \\n         will remain separate units. \\n                                 3-5 '}, vector=None),\n",

Officer Billets . \\n \\n          a.  Command Level .  As at other Coast Guard units, the roles \\n              of commissioned officers are stratified at a marine \\n              safety unit.  At the top is the command level, consisting \\n              of the CO (the OCMI and/or the COTP) and the XO; these \\n              are selected from the 0-6/0-4 grades.  Both of these \\n              command-level officers have \"climbed the ladder\" of \\n              functional experience and training prior to their \\n              selection.  On the other hand, few senior and mid-level \\n              officers are from the same mold.  There will be officers \\n               assigned to command-level billets whose area of expertise \\n              is heavily oriented toward marine inspection, rather than \\n              port safety or licensing and documentation or pollution \\n              response.  Regardless of their professional orientation, \\n              the CO and XO both must be able to respond promptly to \\n              problems and issues raised by the maritime public.  Some \\n              may erroneously believe that the OCMI/COTP is basically \\n              an \"administrator,\" filling a role that any officer of \\n              sufficient grade can handle.  This is not the case.  At \\n              least two-thirds of the staff years allocated to marine \\n              safety command-level billets are programmed to perform \\n              professional duties involving program responsibilities. \\n          b.  General Duty .  Under the CO/XO, officer billets at field \\n              units include department heads, as well as general-duty \\n              officers of 0-4/W-2 grades.  As only the CO/XO billets \\n              are designated formally in official orders, all other \\n              officers are assigned to \"duty.\" It is the prerogative of \\n              the command to make particular assignments once officers \\n              are on board, except for chiefs of licensing departments \\n              who are assigned directly by Headquarters.  It is not \\n              necessary for assignments to be based upon seniority, nor \\n              officers should rotate through assignments which expose \\n \\n               for officers to remain in the same billets during their \\n              entire tours at a unit.  To the maximum extent practical, \\n              them to all aspects of the marine safety programs.  [NOTE: \\n              Smaller units may not have officer billets identified by \\n              specific departments.]  In some cases, responsibility for \\n              more than one department may be vested in the XO or a \\n              subordinate.

Loss of \\nBody Heat  Hypothermia is a lowering of a person’s core temperature.  It occurs when a \\nperson suffers a loss of body heat.  General body hypothermia  is the leading \\ncause of death among shipwrecked crews and other disasters at sea.  If not \\nrecognized and treated promptly, hypothermia can rapidly turn survivors into fatalities.  Survivors in critical hypothermia conditions may suffer a fatal loss of body temperature  from physical exer tion, or as a result of any delay in \\ntaking immediate and positive measures to restore body heat.  Struggling survivors, trying to aid in their own rescue , may drive their body temperature \\ndown to the point where unconsciousness and/or death results.  Survivors \\nremoved from the water and left untreated may suffer further critical loss in \\nbody temperature, bringing on death after being rescued.  Survivors in \\n“warm” water can also suffer from hypothermia if exposed for long enough periods of ti me.  Also, cold air temperatures can bring on hypothermia if \\nadequate protective clothing is not worn. \\nF.5.  \\nSurvivability  Survival times in water vary considerably.  Survival depends on the type of clothing worn, the amount of physical exertion, the blood alcohol  levels, and \\nother factors.  Some survivors, when taken aboard during a SAR  case, may \\nappear to be under the influence of drugs  or alcohol.

The following general guidance for 49 CFR Subchapter   \\n      C  enforcement should apply:      \\n            \\n      (1)  U.S. Navy vessels are public vessels under 49 CFR;   \\n            \\n      (2)  MARAD\\'s National Defense Reserve/Ready Reserve Fleet and  \\n           MSC\\'s United States Naval Service vessels are public vessels  \\n           under 49 CFR, regardless of whether the operator is a   \\n           private entity;       \\n            \\n      (3)  A vessel, that is time or voyage chartered or otherwise  \\n           contracted by the United States, including by MSC or MARAD,  \\n           is not a public vessel under 49 CFR; and    \\n            \\n      (4)  A vessel owned or chartered (bareboat, time, voyage) by a  \\n           foreign government, state, or municipality is not a public  \\n           vessel under 49 CFR.       \\n            \\n  c.  A Federal contractor who is responsible for day to day management  \\n      of a public vessel does not share in the exception from 49 CFR  \\n      jurisdiction that is given to that vessel.  Therefore, while  \\n      MARAD and MSC vessels may be public vessels, this status does not  \\n      exempt the contractor from compliance with the Hazardous   \\n      Materials Regulations (HMR).  The contractor may only avoid those  \\n      provisions that are not applicable to a public vessel.   \\n            \\n  d.  In addition to the above, application of 49 CFR is not dependent  \\n      upon the conveyance being a public vessel, but whether a \"person\"  \\n      is transporting hazardous materials in commerce.  A person, as  \\n      defined in 49 CFR 171.8, includes a government or \"agency or  \\n      instrumentality of any government\" that offers or transports  \\n      hazardous materials in furtherance of a commercial enterprise.  \\n      It has been determined that transportation, when carried out by  \\n      government personnel for a governmental purpose, is not in   \\n      furtherance of a commercial enterprise.  Therefore, even if a  \\n      vessel owned by a state, municipality or foreign government does  \\n      not meet the definition of a public vessel, transportation of  \\n      hazardous materials on such a vessel is not subject to the HMR if  \\n      the vessel is manned by government personnel and operated for a  \\n      governmental purpose.       \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                  1-55  CH-3 '}, vector=None),\n",

If the nature of the distribution is known then it is possible to \\nestimate the POC of a square centered on datum a s a function of the square’s inscribed radius.  \\nIf POD as a function of coverage is also known, then it is possible to find the combination \\nof search area size and coverage for a given level of effort that maximizes the probability of \\nsuccess (POS).  Metho ds for doing this are described in the IAMSAR Manual, Volume II .  \\nThese methods, with the modifications described in this Appendix, comprise the manual \\nmethod approved for USCG use.  \\nH.2.2  Modifications to the IAMSAR Manual Method  \\nH.2.2.1  The modifications to the IAMSAR Manual  methods described in this Appendix are:  \\n(a) The IAMSAR Manual  wind current graph and computations are replaced by the wind \\ncurrent computations given in Paragraph H.3.1 and the wind current worksheet at the end \\nof this Appendix.   Note:  Wind current computations were originally intended for use in \\nthe deep ocean in combination with seasonal average sea surface current values from \\natlases, pilot charts, etc.  Surface current values derived from DMB and SLDMB drift \\ntrajectories  or other direct observations, and those provided by most modern near -real-\\ntime coastal and oceanic circulation models  which are coupled with atmospheric \\ncirculation models , already  contain the wind effects on surface current.  Wind current \\nshould not be added  to surface currents obtained from these sources.  Values from tidal \\ncurrent tables and tidal models do not generally contain a wind driven component, but \\nthe effects of wind in tidal areas are extremely difficult to predict due to the proximity of \\nland and  the limited depth of the water.  Therefore, wind current from the deep ocean \\nmodel is not used inside the 17 fathom  (about 100 foot) curve.  Past experience, local \\nknowledge and sound judgment must be used to determine when and how the wind \\nmay be affecti ng currents in tidal areas.  \\n(b) Additional worksheets are provided for computing reversing tidal and other currents.  \\n(c) The table of probable errors of initial position associated with different means of \\nnavigation contains more means of navigation than t he corresponding table in the \\nIAMSAR Manual .  However, the two tables agree when the method of navigation is the \\nsame.  The same is true for other tables of probable position error associated with types \\nof craft .  Important note:   The probable error associated with any position is not actually \\na function of the means of navigation.  The table of probable errors represents the \\nminimum probable error that should be associated with each listed means of navigation.  \\nFor search plannin g purposes, these values should be increased to reflect the search \\nplanner’s confidence in the position and other factors that affect the probable error \\nestimate .  Additional information is provided in Section H.3.3 below.  \\n(d) The leeway divergence angles given in this Appendix are rounded up to the next highest \\nwhole degree and are therefore more accurate than those in the IAMSAR Manual , which \\nare rounded up to the next highest multiple of five degrees.  However , all leeway data for \\nboth this Appendix and the IAMSAR Manual  are based on the same research and are \\ntherefore otherwise consistent.  \\n(e) The sweep width tables given in this Appendix include more altitudes and therefore have \\nmore entries than those in the IAMSAR Manual .

Per the direction provided in Enclosure (13) Auxiliary COVID -19 Reconstitution Guidance Version 2, paragraph E.2. as well as earlier \\nguidance, units have been conducting online meetings. In ma ny instances, member \\nparticipation in these meetings has reportedly been greater than prior in- person only meetings. \\nBy eliminating the special circumstances wording, we are providing a means for units to routinely conduct electronic meetings with an oppor tunity for greater member participation. \\nWhile the climate is changing and units are transitioning back to more in -person meetings, the \\n\"new\" normal should recognize the realities of the virtual world in which we now operate.

Minimum Number Of Mates.   (2014, 2017 ) \\n46 U.S.C. 8301 requires a minimum number of mates based on vessel tonnage, length of \\nvoyage, and in some cases upon vessel type.  These mate manning levels are not discretionary.  An OCMI may not authorize fewer mates than provided within this \\nstatutory section.  As provided in 46 CFR 15.810(f), Commandant (CG -CVC) may \\nconsider reductions to the number of mates required when special circumstances allowing \\na vessel to be safely operated can be demonstrated.  Special circumstances may include a \\nnational emergency as proclaimed by the President or for the purposes of national defense.   \\nHowever, this does not extend to altering the watch system requirements of 46 U.S.C. \\n8104 (see 46 U.S.C.A. 8104, 2007, Notes of Decision, Note 6. Number of Watches).  \\nRequests should be routed via the OCMI.  \\n \\na. On vessels subject to STCW, the individual meeting the requirement of this section  \\nmust also hold an STCW endorsement as officer in ch arge of a navigational watch  \\nwith the appropriate tonnage for the vessel upon which he or she is operating, except \\nas noted in §15.105(g) of this part for vessels on domestic near -coastal voyages.  \\n \\n2. Master, Mate, Or Engineer Officer Requirement.   (2014)  \\n \\na. 46 U.S.C. 8304 requires persons serving as master, mate, or engineer on any vessel of \\n200 GRT or more operating on the high seas (e.g., beyond the boundary line) to hold \\na license or MMC officer endorsement appropriate for the route and tonnage of the \\nvessel.  \\n  \\nb. The above notwithstanding, neither the statute nor the implementing regulations expressly specify the grade of credential required to fill either the requirement for \\nmate or engineer.  Chapter B2  of this Volume does provide delineation in respect to \\nthe su ggested grades for the sample manning scales.  In STCW, there is little \\ndiscretion in specifying the manning levels for vessels subject to the provisions of STCW in relation to the mandatory mini mum requirements for certification in the \\nmanagement lev el capacities.  However, in the case of the operational level, STCW \\nmakes no delineation between 2nd or 3rd Mate (only OICNW -II/1) and 2nd [U.S.] or \\n3rd assistant engineer (only OICEW -III/1).  In this case, the grade for the mates and \\nengineers at the oper ational level are variables for the OCMI to consider when \\nestablishing the manning level.  In doing so, the OCMI should consider the job \\ndescriptions and responsibilities for all positions as identified and defined in the \\nrelevant safety management system.   \\n \\n3. Working Conditions And Watch Requirements.   (2014)  \\n46 U.S.C. 8104 has a number of subsections concerning working conditions and watch \\nrequirements that may result in a higher number of mates being assigned than might \\notherwise be required by 46 U.S.C. 8 301. \\n \\na. Section 8104(a) requires a minimum rest period for the officer in charge of the \\nnavigation watch upon a vessel's departure from port or immediately after the vessel \\ndeparts.  A sufficient number of mates must be assigned to ensure all in -port duties \\nmay be accomplished safely and a rested crew is available for departure.  46 CFR \"}, vector=None),\n",

If the towing boat slows and does not tend the towline, \\nthe towline could sink and foul the rudder/s and propeller/s or be \\nsucked into the waterjets.\\n(02)If the towing boat turns sharply to either side, tripping can occur.  \\nTripping is when a boat is pulled sideways by an opposing force. If \\nthe towline is out of alignment (not in line) and pulls sideways, the \\ntowing boat will heel over, often beyond its ability to right itself.\\nCAUTION!\\nB.1.a.  Weather \\nConditionsCurrent, wind, sea, or swell from astern can cause yawing and add to the \\nproblem of the tow overrunning the towing boat.  Current broadside to the \\ntow creates difficulty in holding the tow due to side slip, causing the tow to \\nyaw.\\nNOTE \\nB.1.b.  Pre-\\nPlanningConsidering the number of potential problems that can occur, the operator \\nshould carefully assess all possible situations and conditions to pre-plan steps \\nto take in case of a PIW emergency.\\nCAUTION!\\nNever make sharp turns when towing!  Turns should be made in slow and small increments.  \\nAlways try to keep the towed vessel almost directly astern.\\nBar or inlet conditions will compound all these problems.\\nTripping occurs more frequently when the towed vessel is larger or heavier than the towing boat.\\nSlow calculated moves are better than a “knee jerk” response.'}, vector=None),\n",

Where \\nEDS problems are confirmed or suspected  it may be appropriate to use the SLDMB data \\ndirectly.  \\n(d) The SAROPS Currents and Winds Sketch tool can be accessed under Tools / Extensions \\n/ Currents Toolbox. Within the Currents Tools, create a ‘Hydrodyn amic Grid’ by double \\nclicking. A grid should be created matching the AOI and time period required by the \\nSAROPS run.

Planning For Natural Disaster Response .  In general, COTP\\'s shall consult \\n          CG-368-2.  A \"natural disaster\" is an occurrence or imminent threat of \\n          widespread or severe damage, injury, or loss of life or property resulting \\n          from any natural cause, including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, wind or \\n          wave action, volcanic activity, epidemic, contamination, blight, drought, \\n          or infestation.  The primary responsibility for disaster response rests at \\n          the local and state levels.  Federal assistance may be provided when local \\n          and state governments are unable to cope with the effects of the disaster; \\n          authorities frequently request Coast Guard assistance in such cases as \\n          severe port and waterfront damage caused by coastal storms. \\n  \\n      6.  Planning For Response To Civil Disorder And Terrorism .  See volume VII (TO \\n          BE DEVELOPED) of this manual. \\n  \\n      7.  Recovery Of Foreign Military Materiel .  Whenever possible, Coast Guard \\n          personnel shall recover foreign materiel.  All foreign materiel should be \\n          handled as potentially explosive.  See volume VII (TO BE DEVELOPED) of \\n          this manual for further information on recovery and reporting of foreign \\n          materiel. \\n \\n  C.  Port Emergency Planning .  [NOTE:  For further information, see volume VII (TO \\n      BE DEVELOPED) of this manual.]  Under Executive Order (E.O.) 11490, as amended \\n      by E.O. 11921, broad emergency preparedness functions have been assigned to \\n      the Maritime Administration (MARAD).  The functions for which MARAD is \\n      responsible fall into two distinct phases:  Phase 1 concerns peacetime \\n      planning for operation of U.S. seaports under emergency conditions; Phase 2 \\n      implements these plans upon the declaration of a national emergency.  To \\n      ensure coordination of MARAD programs concerning port utilization and control \\n      with Coast Guard responsibilities as delineated by E.O. 10173, direct liaison \\n      is maintained between Commandant (G-OIS) and (G-WPE), and MARAD\\'s Office of \\n      Port and Intermodal Development.  Commandant (G-WPE) has been designated as \\n      Coast Guard liaison for port utilization and control and questions concerning \\n      subject should be referred to them.  In February 1959, MARAD requested 100 \\n      port authorities on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts to initiate \\n      preparedness planning for their ports.  Since that time, similar requests have \\n      been made concerning selected ports of the Great Lakes, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto \\n      Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  The basic premise of a port preparedness \\n      program is that local authorities can best determine their own emergency needs \\n      and develop detailed methods of meeting those needs with available resources. \\n      MARAD provides fundamental guidance and coordinates the efforts of neighboring \\n      ports having common interests. \\n  \\n      1.  Port Planning Committees . \\n  \\n          a.  Planning Features .  At the local level, actual port emergency \\n              operations plans are developed by port planning committees.  The \\n              committee members are usually appointed by the local port authority or \\n              port industry, under a \"delegation\" of responsibility from MARAD. \\n              Each committee prepares a plan with universal planning base features. \\n              These include: \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                     6-13 '}, vector=None),\n",

The key elements of dead reckoning are the course steered and the distance traveled without __________________ to current, \\nwind, or other external forces.  \\n3. Only courses __________________________________ are used to determine a DR.  \\n4. DR plots should be labeled at least every ____________________ and at  every ________________________________ or \\n_______________________ change.  \\n5.

(cont\\'d) regulation(s) violated and make specific recommendations \\n            concerning the proceedings to be instututed.  In particular, \\n            the transmittal letter should include information on local \\n            conditions which may have a bearing on the violation (e.g., \\n            implications with respect of local compliance, the previous \\n            record of the offender, or the general state of compliance in \\n            the locality). \\n \\n  B.  Penalty Assessment Under The FWPCA .  Under Section 311 of the \\n      FWPCA(33 U.S.C. 1321), the Coast Guard is responsible for ensuring \\n      that reports of discharge under Section 311 are investigated, and \\n      that every proven violation results in the assessment and collection \\n      of a civil penalty.  The district commander is responsible for the \\n      investigation of discharges and referral of appropriate cases to the \\n      hearing officer.  The hearing officer is responsible for \\n      administrating cases fairly and inpartically, in accordance with 33 \\n      CFR 1.07 and for issuing decisions based on the facts of the case \\n      and the applicable laws and regulations (see section 5.A. above). \\n      This section is intended to described each phase of civil penalty \\n      proceedings for cases involving unlawful discharges of oil and \\n      hazardous substances, from the spill to the collection of the \\n      penalty.  [NOTE:  Action taken by a state or municipality, or a \\n      federal agency other than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \\n      under Section 311(b)(6)(B) of the FWPCA, does not not obviate the \\n      requirement for appropriate coast Guard civil penalty action.] \\n \\n      1.  Discharge Investigations .  While it is not explicity stated \\n          that the Coast Guard must conduct an investigation to assess a \\n          penalty under Section 311(b)(6), investigation is obviously \\n          necessary to develop evidence proving the elements of the \\n          offense.  It is also necessary to obtain corollary information \\n          (e.g., the gravity of the offense) which may be considered in \\n           assessing a penalty. \\n          a.  Coast Guard Responsibility .  In the absence or specific \\n              legal requirements to the contrary, an implicit \\n              responsibility to investigate discharges rests on the Coast \\n              Guard.  Agreements should be made among Coast Guard district \\n              commanders, EPA regional administrators, and state \\n              authorities to distribute investigative burdens; the \\n              predesignated on-scene coordinator\\'s (OSC\\'s) limits of \\n              authority should be specified in these agreements, where \\n              practicable.  These agreements should outline the minimal \\n              information to be included in the investigative report. \\n \\n          b.  Outside Assistance .  The Commandant recognizes that \\n              personnel and budgetary constraints may preclude the \\n              investigation of every reported discharge by Coast Guard \\n              personnel.  Assistance from outside resources, such as state \\n              agencies, is encouraged in such circumstances for timely \\n              response.  In certain instances, the EPA may be requested to \\n              forward a \"Section 308 letter\" to the suspented violator to \\n              supplement or aid an investigation.  The answers to the \\n              questions in this letter may furnish information, not \\n              otherwise obtainable, to support the assessment of a civil \\n              penalty action. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 5-10 '}, vector=None),\n",

Semi-\\nDisplacement \\nHull The semi- displacement hull is a combination of characteristics of the \\ndisplacement hull and the planing hull. This means that up to a certain power \\nlevel and speed (power/speed ratio), the hull remains in the displacement \\nmode. Beyond this point, the hull is raised to a partial plane. Essentially, the \\nsemi-displacement hull, like the displacement hull, always remains in the \\nwater; it never gets “on-plane.” When in the displacemen t mode, the \\npower/speed ratio is similar to the power/speed ratio described above for the \\ndisplacement hull. When in the semi- planing mode, it is affected by a \\ncombination of forces for the displacement mode and some for the planing \\nmode. Thus, while a small power increase will increase speed, the amount of \\nresulting speed will not be as great as the same power increase would produce \\nfor a planing hull. \\nKeel \\nB.10.

Planing \\nHullAt rest, the planing hull and the displacement hull both displace the water \\naround them.  The planing hull reacts nearly the same as a displacement hull \\nwhen it initially gets underway -it takes considerable power to produce a small \\nincrease in speed.  However, at a certain point, external forces acting on the \\nshape cause an interesting effect - the hull is lifted up onto the surface of the \\nwater (see Figure 3-4 ). The planing hull skims along the surface of the water \\nwhereas the displacement hull always forces water around it.  This is called \\nplaning.\\nOnce “on-plane,” the power/speed ratio is considerably altered- very little \\npower increase results in a large increase in speed.  Crewmembers must apply \\nor reduce power gradually when going from the displacement mode to the \\nplaning mode or from the planing mode to the displacement mode.  When the \\npower is decreased gradually, the hull makes an even, steady transition, like \\nslowly moving the hand from above the water’s surface, through it, and into \\nthe liquid below.  However, if power is rapidly decreased, the transition will \\nbe a rough one, for the hull will slap the surface of the water like the slap \\nresulting by hitting a liquid surface with the hand. \\nFigure 3-4 \\nPlaning Hulls\\n Additionally, the rapid “re-entry” into the displacement mode from above the \\nsurface, through the surface, and back into the water causes rapid deceleration \\nas the forces in the water exert pressure against the hull.

They are designed to provide sufficient buoyancy to support downed flight crew after they bail out or ditch into the water. These preservers are rapid inflation style with an auxiliary oral inflation device.  Accessory survival items may or may not \\nbe attached, depending upon the type of preserver. If not attached, \\nsurvival items sho uld be carried in the pockets of the flight suits or in \\nsurvival vests. All survival equipment should be attached to personnel or the raft with a  lanyard.  \\nIt is imperative that all crewmembers be familiar with the donning, \\nfitting, care, and operation of t he preserver that is used in the aircraft. \\nOnce aboard a raft, the preserver should be kept inflated in case the raft capsizes or is deflated.  \\n Life Raft  A carbon dioxide cylinder inflates the raft when the lanyard is pulled. There is a valve for o ral inflation that closes automatically by spring \\npressure when it is not held open. Handles or straps are provided as aids for boarding the raft.  \\nThe best way to board a life raft is to grasp the boarding strap and kick the feet vigorously while pulling elbows and life preserver over the raft tube, then grasp the boarding strap on the other side and roll into the raft. For the one -person raft, it is better to board over the small end than the \\nside to lessen the possibility of the raft capsizing. T hrust your body over \\nthe small end of the raft face down, and then roll over to a face -up \\nposition. Extreme care should be taken by personnel boarding the raft to ensure that no sharp objects puncture the fabric of the life raft. A sea anchor is attached t o the raft by a line. Deploy the sea anchor to stabilize \\nthe raft and to minimize your drift from the location of the  ditching.  \\nThe life raft normally available to Auxiliary flight crews typically \\ncontains little survival equipment and no water or rations.  During the \\nannual training sessions, the raft should be inflated, and the crews should \\nbe made aware of what equipment is included and how to use it.

CG \\nEPLOs work closely with their respective Di strict IMPA and CG EPLO Coordinator, \\nthe HQ EPLO Reserve Coordinator, and th e HQ EPLO Program Manager (CG-CPE).  \\nFurther information on EPLO roles and re sponsibilities is found Chapter 7 Paragraph \\nC of this Manual. \\nc. ICS Coordinator . The District ICS Coordinator wo rks closely with district staff \\nelements and field units to determine and address ICS training needs. This position \\nwill work closely with the Area ICS coordi nator to ensure District and field unit \\nneeds are identified and prioritized.  \\nd. District Response Advisory Teams (DRATs ) and District Response Groups (DRGs) .  \\nFor the purposes of NRF implementation within the Coast Guard, the DRAT forms the core of the DRG.  The DRG is not an ope rational entity in the traditional sense; it \\nis rather a concept that provides a framework  within Districts to coordinate additional \\nresponse resources, including equipment, expe rts, and funds.  The intent is for DRAT \\npersonnel and relevant DRG personnel and reso urces to support a District wide all-\\nincident, all-hazard response posture.

Procedures For Handling Pollution Incidents Resulting From Outer  \\n          Continental Shelf (OCS) Activities .  Response procedures for pollution \\n          incidents resulting from OCS activities generally parallel those under the \\n          FWPCA.  A basic difference is that the Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation \\n          Fund established by the OCSLA Amendments (43 U.S.C. 1801-1824) also funds \\n          third-party damages incurred as a result of an OCS spill.  The statute \\n          also requires that a formal Notice of Designation confirming the source be \\n          issued to the responsible party.  The function of the Notice of \\n          Designation i to trigger the claims advertising obligation of the owner, \\n          operator, or guarantor of the alleged pollution source.  A separate Notice \\n          of Designation shall be sent to each owner, operator, or guarantor.  33 \\n          CFR 135.309 contains the information required in a Notice of Designation, \\n          and a sample is found in Figure 7-13.  Current policy requires the OSC to \\n          obtain authority to issue a Notice of Designation from the Fund Manager, \\n          Commandant (G-WFR), or an authorized representative, on a case-by-case \\n          basis.  POLREPS shall include the term \"OCS Oil\" in the subject line to \\n          alert personnel of the potential need for Notice of Designation authority \\n          or use of the Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund.  The Fund Manager \\n          also determines when the incident requires public advertisement to advise \\n          potential claimants of the spill.  Guidelines for determining the type, \\n          scope, frequency, and content of advertisements are stated in 33 CFR \\n          135.313-319.  Since it may take some time to determine the advertising \\n          requirements to be included in the Notice of Designation, the OSC should \\n          issue a separate Notice of Federal Interest indicating that a subsequent \\n          Notice of Designation may or will follow.  To ensure removal operations \\n          are initiated expeditiously, the OSC is authorized to obligate funds from \\n          the FWPCA 311(k) fund for OSC spills.  Reimbursement from the Offshore Oil \\n          Pollution Compensation Fund to the FWPCA 311(k) fund will be accomplished \\n          by Commandant (G-WFR). \\n  \\n      6.  Funding Deepwater Port (DWP) Pollution Incident Response .  Response \\n          procedures for incidents resulting from DWP activities are the same as \\n          those specified in section 7.B above, except that the DWP Liability Fund \\n          pays for federally-funded cleanup and third-party damages resulting from \\n          the incident.  As is the case with OCS spills, the Fund Manager, \\n          Commandant (G-WFR), must be promptly notified when use of the DWP Fund is \\n          indicated.  As is the case with OCS spills, the FWPCA 311(k) Pollution \\n          Fund may be used to initiate federal removal operations and then be \\n          reimbursed from the DWP Liability Fund. \\n  \\n      7.  Funding Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP) Oil Pollution Incidents .  Response \\n          procedures to incidents involving TAP oil are the same as those specified \\n          in section 7.B above, except that the TAP Liability Fund is liable for all \\n          damages, including cleanup costs, sustained by any person or entity, \\n          public or private, as a result of the discharge of oil from a vessel \\n          transporting such oil.  TAP Fund liability continues until the TAP oil is \\n          first brought ashore at a U.S. port.  The TAP Fund is unique in that it is \\n          established as a non-profit corporation administered by a Board of \\n          Trustees, including representatives from the U.S. Department of the \\n          Interior.  The Fund must be promptly notified when possible use of the TAP \\n          Fund is indicated.

Natural Lighting  \\n  \\n          Natural or available light is the easiest with which to work,  \\n          since you will not have to fuss with calculating distance between  \\n          a light source and the subject.  This may be used both out doors  \\n          and indoors.  When shooting with color film using available light \\n          indoors, alternative light sources will produce some unexpected \\n          results.  Florescent light will produce green pictures on outdoor \\n          color film.  Incandescent lighting (the ordinary light bulb) will  \\n          produce a red cast to your pictures.  Some processing labs can  \\n          filter out the color distortion when they set up the printing  \\n          program for your film.  Be sure to note the need for filtering \\n          when you order the processing if your lab can accommodate this. \\n  \\n      6.  Using A Flash  \\n  \\n          Most cameras will accommodate a flash unit, which is synchronized  \\n          to operate as you press the shutter button.  This will simulate  \\n          the color of day light, and is most effective when using daylight  \\n          color film indoors or in the evening.  \"Fill flash\" is an  \\n          effective use of the flash unit when you wish to eliminate \\n          dark shadows in a day light photo. \\n \\n  E.  Film Selection  \\n  \\n      A wide variety of film can be purchased, but how do you decide upon  \\n      the correct on for the job?  There seem to be a great many  \\n      specifications - speed, light sensitivity, daylight or artificial  \\n      light, black and white, color, print or slide film.  When selecting \\n      film, it is important to first consider which type and speed best  \\n      suits your needs.  It is true that you can have slides made from  \\n      color prints, and prints made from colored slides, but you will get \\n      the best quality for the most economical price if you use the film \\n      selected for it\\'s intended purpose. \\n  \\n      1.  Types of Film  \\n  \\n          Film is available for the 35 mm camera in two basic types; print  \\n          film and slide film.  Each has its advantages and disadvantages.   \\n          Selection of film is dependent upon your particular needs. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6-5 '}, vector=None),\n",

Push -Mode Passenger -Carrying Integrated Towing Vessel -Barge  Combinations (ITB) \\n(Inland Waters).   (2014, 2017 ) \\nPush -mode passenger -carrying integrated towing vessel -barge combinations are those in \\nwhich a specially designed propulsion unit (towing vessel) is mated to the passenger -\\ncarrying barge.  The navigation and operation of the combined unit can be accomplished \\nfrom a control station located on the passenger -carrying barge.  The barge cannot operate \\nindependently of the towing vessel, which provides its power and other passenger services.  These push -mode passenger -carrying ITB combinations are designed, outfitted \\nand intended to operate as a single unit and therefore will be manned as a single vessel.  The master and mat es must hold inspected vessel credentials with tonnage limitations \\nappropriate to the aggregate tonnage of the towing vessel and barge combination (see NVIC 2 -81, as amended).  Masters and mates of inspected vessels greater than 200 GRT  \\nmay operate such v essels with a completed TOAR and 30 or 90 days of familiarization, as \\nappropriate (see 46 CFR 11.464/465).  The rare scenario of a push- mode passenger -\\ncarrying integrated towing vessel -barge combination of 200 GRT or less is best handled \\nby the local OCMI on a case- by-case.    \\n \\nCombined Unit.  \\n  \\n \\n \\nRoute  \\nMaster  \\nMate  \\nAble Seamen  \\nOrdinary \\nSeamen  \\nRadio \\nOfficers  \\nPatrolman/\\nWatchman  \\nDeckhands  \\nCertificated \\nLifeboatmen  \\nChief \\nEngineer  \\nAssistant \\nEngineer  \\nQMED \\n(Fireman/ \\nWatertender)  \\nQMED (Oilers)  \\nTankermen  \\nGeneral \\nOperations  1 *1 - - - - * [1,2,3,4] - - - - - - \\n[1] One deckhand for each passenger deck.   \\n[2] Additional deckhands based on number of passengers on board and hours of operations (See  \\n      table in Section B2.D.3 above ). \\n[3] See B4.B.1. for additional dis cussion on the impact of international conventions on certain   \\n      vessels employing deckhands.  \\n[4] Not credentialed \\n* Denotes variable.

Description Chemical agents can be very effective fire fighting tools.  However, they can \\nbe ineffective and sometimes dangerous if they are not used properly.  \\nLearning the proper use of each chemical agent, including its advantages and \\ndisadvantages, before using it to fight a fire is essential.  Two chemical agents \\nare discussed below:\\n(01)Carbon dioxide (CO 2).\\n(02)Dry Chemical /Potassium bicarbonate (PKP).\\nF.11. Carbon \\nDioxide (CO 2)CO2is a colorless gas about 50 percent heavier than air.  When released from \\nits container, the gas expands to 450 times its stored volume and smothers a \\nfire by temporarily removing the oxygen.   Because it is a non-conductor of \\nelectricity, CO 2is the primary agent for class C fires. \\nCAUTION!\\nF.11.a.  CO 2\\nEffectivenessCO2 is effective on small class A, B, and C fires.  It has a very limited cooling \\ncapacity and does not permanently remove oxygen from a fuel source.  Therefore, \\nCO2is only effective in knocking down flames.  Unless CO 2is used continuously \\nuntil all flames are extinguished, the fire could re-ignite (re-flash).  In fact, the \\nlikelihood of a re-flash is greater when CO 2is used against a fire than any other \\ntype of agent.\\nA continuous discharge of CO 2from a fully charged 10-pound extinguisher will \\nlast approximately 40 to 45 seconds.  The effective range for the portable CO 2\\nextinguisher is approximately 5 feet. A distance of more than 5 feet may cause the \\nCO2to mix with the air and become ineffective .\\nCO2should never be used alone to fight a major fire.'}, vector=None),\n",

The DNACOs are responsible for all arrangements to include development of the \\nNAPM agenda and selecting and contracting (an AuxA contract) the hotel. NACO (or VNACO) \\nand the CHDIRAUX (or representative) usually attend.  \\ni.  At NACO’s discretion, the NAPMs may be combined into an Auxiliary Flag Meeting with the \\nNEXCOM, DCOs, DCOSs, and DIRAUXs invited to attend. NACO may invite other persons \\nto attend as well.  \\nii. Planning for the Auxiliary Flag Meeting will also be the responsibility of the DNACOs with \\nVNACO being the host. The NAPM and Auxiliary Flag Meeting provide an opportunity for \\nface-to-face exchange of information among the District and National Auxilary leadership.  \\niii. Attendance at the NAPM by Coast Guard personnel is by invitation of the \\nDNACOs with the purpose of observing and providing Coast Guard input \\nwhen requested during the meeting.  \\nb. National Training Meeting (N-TRAIN) - N-TRAIN is a training event for selected \\nDistrict Officers normally held in the last week of January.  \\ni.

General  Flying beyond the gliding distance from shore is an offshore operation.  \\nShore is “ land that is suitable for an emergency landing with a reasonable \\nexpectation of landing without injury to persons on board the aircraft.”  \\nSingle -engine aircraft may not proceed more than 5 0 miles offshore \\nunless authorized by the Air S tation Commanding Officer.  \\nMulti -engine aircraft may operate offshore without limitation , other than \\nlimits set by the Air Station Commanding Officer . Co-Pilots may only fly \\nas PIC within gliding distance from the shore.  \\nWhen working with a surface vesse l, helicopter, or other recovery asset \\nwhich a communications guard is maintained, the shore effectively \\nextends to the location of the communications guard.  \\nWhen operating missions offshore, the flight crew may experience \\nconditions not normally encounter ed in personal flying. Maritime safety \\nmissions, including SAR prosecution, are typically flown at a lower \\naltitude than would normally be chosen for an over -water route. Offshore \\nweather may be quite different from inshore or even shoreline airports. It \\nis not unusual for haze conditions offshore to blend with reduced visual \\ncues created by calm water and contribute to a lack of spatial awareness. Due to these circumstances, certain procedures have been mandated for all offshore operations in Auxiliary air craft operating under orders, and it \\nis recommended that at least one pilot aboard be instrument- rated when \\noperating out of sight of land.\\n \\nE.2. Special \\nRequirements  The following are special requirements to be met before any offshore operation is conducte d or contemplated:   \\n• The pilot must be a first pilot or aircraft commander  \\n• All crewmembers must be current in Egress Training and Water Survival training  \\n• Appropriate PPE must be worn or  carried  \\n• The aircraft must be equipped with specific rescue and survival equipment, such as rafts, signaling, and first -aid gear \\n• Offshore missions are flown only in daytime and under  VMC \\nNon-operational offshore overflight may be authorized at night or IMC.  \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

Running Fix . Used when limited objects are available for taking LOPs and the vessel remains \\non a consistent course. This type of  fix advances or retires a LOP taken to the same object at \\ntwo different times to fix the vessel’s position  \\n2. Verify Vessel Position . Radar/chart matching involves verifying the vessel’s position with the \\ninstalled eNav system and the radar to match features  that appear on both (e.g. Radar overlay \\nfeature on eNav System). The use of a fathometer to match observed depth with charted depth is \\nalso a means of verification.  \\n3. Evaluate Position Fixes . Whether a fix is taken by visual or electronic means, it must be \\nevaluated. This means the fix must be analyzed with due regard to its accuracy, relation to the vessel’s intended track, proximity of shoal water or other navigational hazards, environmental conditions and their effect on a vessel’s intended track, and any  other situation dependent factors \\nthat must be considered for safe navigation. The following Paragraphs describe some of the external factors that may influence a vessel’s position relative to its intended track:  \\na. Set and Drift . Set and Drift is the cumula tive effect of wind, tide, and current on a vessel’s \\nmovement through the water. Set is the direction, (True or Magnetic degrees), these cumulative influences have moved the vessel towards, relative to the vessel’s expected position. Drift is how these cum ulative influences have affected the planned speed of the \\nvessel.  Navigation personnel can adjust actual courses and speeds to counteract the cumulative influences of Set and Drift to ensure the planned direction and speed of the vessel is achieved.  \\n \\nb. Vess el Advance and Transfer . Especially  during or after executing a turn, deviations from \\nintended track and track speed may occur from the turning characteristics of the vessel. There are many factors that influence a vessel’s advance and transfer that must b e accounted for in \\nthe process of navigation. Advance is the distance along the vessel’s current track it will travel during a turn. Transfer is the distance perpendicular, or the slide, a vessel will experience as it travels through a turn. Most electroni c navigation systems enable operators \\nto input a vessel’s tactical data into the system for the purposes of computed wheel over points, slide lines, or turn points. This computation must be performed manually on paper charts.  \\n \\nc. Plotting Errors . Fix evaluat ion must also account for the potential for plotting errors and \\ninaccuracies with individual LOPs or radar ranges in use due to non- simultaneous \\nobservations or inaccuracies with how the LOP or radar range was determined. Consistent \\nissues with individual objects or radar ranges may necessitate changing the object or radar range used for navigation.  \\n \\nJ. Dead Reckoning . Both electronic and paper chart navigation utilize dead reckoning, which is the \\nprocess of plotting a course from a known position, at a given speed and duration of time, to determine a vessel’s anticipated or estimat ed position along a trackline. When compared to the \\nvessel’s known or fixed position at a specific time, it enables personnel to determine the effect of '}, vector=None),\n",

Stern \\nDrives and \\nOutboardsThe coxswain shall use the directed thrust to pull the stern to one side or the \\nother. As the power is applied aft of the transom he/she should, use care to \\nkeep the bow from falling off course due to winds, avoiding cavitation that \\ncan easily occur when backing with a lower unit. Propeller si de force is \\npresent, but is offset through helm. A lower unit that is not providing thrust is \\nnot efficient when trying to steer while backing. It is better to keep steady, \\nslow RPMs than to vary between high power and neutral. \\nB.26.a.  Single-\\nOutboard/ \\nOutdriveFor single-outboard/outdrive, propeller side force is offset by turning the helm \\nslightly to the right.  Astern power is then applied gradually, but care should \\nbe taken not to cause propeller cavitation.\\nB.26.b.  Twin-\\nOutboard/ \\nOutdrive If astern power is matched, propeller side forces will cancel.  As with twin \\ninboards, offsetting any stern swing with helm should be attempted before \\nusing asymmetric power.\\nIf less thrust than that provided by both drives at clutch speed is needed, one \\nmotor or engine should be used.  This will keep speed low but will keep thrust \\navailable for steering, rather than shifting one or both engines from reverse to \\nneutral.  If using one unit, compensate with helm for propeller side force and \\nthe increased, off-centered drag caused by the other lower unit. \\nB.27. Waterjets Waterjets draw water in through an inlet grate in the hull, accelerated by means \\nof an impeller, and thrust it out the transom in a small, high-velocity stream \\nthrough a steerable nozzle. This nozzle is fitted with a reversing bucket, the \\ndeflector that drops down and deflects water forward to stop or reverse the \\nboat. There is no propeller side force and thrust is directed as with an outboard. \\nGoing from forward to reverse thrust has no marine gear or drive train to slow \\nthings. Thrust is simply redirected with the “bucket.” Unless thrust is applied \\nand being directed, there is no directional control at all.  The power must be \\non and applied to steer either forward or in reverse. \\nBursts of power astern when backing should be avoided.  Bursts of power \\nwhen making astern thrust will excessively aerate the waterjet intake flow \\nahead of the transom. '}, vector=None),\n",

The Awareness Stage is generally initiated \\nby some event that alerts the SAR System to the existence or possibility of a SAR incident.  \\nExamples of such events include distress broadcasts from distressed craft, reports of \\nemergency beacon activation, sudden severe weather in areas known to be populated with \\nvessels that could be endangered by it , etc. \\nOften  information is incomplete about an incident or potential incident when the Awareness \\nStage is initiated.  Therefore, it is incumbent upon all SAR personnel involved, but \\nespecially the SMC, to continue investigative efforts to learn as much as  possible about the \\nincident and related matters.  These investigative efforts must continue at least until the case \\nconclusion ( closed or active search has been suspended pending further developments ).  If \\na case study is done, then investigative efforts will continue until the case study has been \\ncompleted.  Investigative efforts require good interviewing skills to obtain pertinent \\ninformation from reporting sources and good analysis skills to piece together the facts and \\ndata obtained in order to develop  one or more consistent, coherent “pictures” or “scenarios” \\nof what may have happened to the survivors.  There are a variety of tools and aids for \\ninvestigation, including data collection forms, historical summaries and knowledge of p ast \\nsimilar incidents.   Methods for gathering more information include following leads, \\nidentifying and interviewing additional potential reporting sources who may have pertinent \\ninformation about the distressed, missing, overdue, or unreported craft and/or its passengers \\nand c rew, communications searches, etc.  These investigative methods should be used \\nthroughout the prosecution of the case.  A ctive searching  on scene using visual and \\nelectronic  sensors  is also an investigative technique,  but it is a highly specialized and ver y \\nexpensive method that requires a significant amount of planning and coordination to be \\neffective .  However, it may be the only way to successfully resolve the case  and save lives .  \\nIt is important to understand that searching is done in addition to, not instead of, other \\ninvestigative activities.  \\n \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

Station \\nKeepingCoxswains must learn to manage the effects of environmental forces by using \\npower and helm to maintain their position next to an object.  Station keeping \\nis defined as maintaining distance, position and aspect to or from an object.  \\nWith twin propulsion, coxswains need to develop the skill s required to \\nmaintain any aspect to an object during most conditions.  Though many single-\\ndrive boats are thought to be less maneuverable, coxswains should fully \\ndevelop single- drive station keeping skills should the need arise. Station \\nkeeping should be practiced during various levels of wind, seas, and current.\\nNOTE\\nC.1.a.  \\nManeuvering \\nZoneEach situation requires a safe maneuvering zone to reach an optimumposition \\nnear the object so an evolution can safely occur and can be done effectively \\n(e.g., equipment transfer, object recovery, surveillance, etc.).  Staying in the \\nmaneuvering zone keeps you out of the danger zone and gives you a way out \\nif you encounter problems while station keeping.\\nBefore station keeping perform the following procedures to determine a safe \\nand effective maneuvering zone:\\nCAUTION !\\nAll coxswains of twin-drive vessels must frequently train for single-drive operation.  This includes \\nstation keeping.\\nWhen station keeping, always have a safe escape route to get clear of the object or any hazard. While\\nstation keeping, ensure the escape route stays clear. This may require changing position to establish a \\nnew escape route.'}, vector=None),\n",

District commanders who \\n              receive requests for clarification or interpretation of the \\n              MOU regarding a specific facility should contact the \\n              appropriate regional office of EPA and arrange for joint \\n              inspection of the facility.  Facility owners or operators \\n              should be advised to request a determination inspection in \\n              writing, stating the reason for the request, and include a \\n              general description of the facility.  Copies of the request \\n              and the EPA/USCG determination shall be forwarded by \\n              Commandant (G-WPE).  If the problem remains unresolved after \\n               consultation between EPA and Coast Guard representatives, \\n              the case should be forwarded to Commandant (G-WPE) for \\n              resolution. \\n          b.  Pollution Response .  The FWPCA and the Comprehensive \\n              Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act \\n              (CERCLA) are the most important legislative mandates \\n              supporting the Marine Environmental Response (MER) Program. \\n              Key provisions of the FWPCA and CERCLA, including response \\n              authority and administration of \"revolving/trust\" funds, are \\n              delegated to the Coast Guard and EPA under E.O.\\'s 11735 and \\n              12316, respectively.  An overview of the roles and \\n              responsibilities of each agency for coordinating responses \\n              is found in the NCP (40 CFR 300).  The Coast Guard is \\n              charged with providing a federal predesignated OSC in the \\n              coastal areas, the U.S. waters of the Great Lakes, and \\n              specified ports and harbors on inland rivers.  The EPA \\n              maintains that responsibility for all other inland areas. \\n              (By the October 1981 Instrument of Redelegation, SECDOT \\n              redelegated certain CERCLA functions relating to facilities \\n              to the Administrator of EPA.) Regional contingency plans \\n              (RCP\\'s) delineate the exact boundaries of each OSC\\'s area of \\n              responsibility.  EPA also will generally provide the SSC for \\n              responses in the inland areas (see volume VI of this manual). \\n \\n      12. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) . \\n \\n          a.  Responsibilities .  The NTSB was established within DOT in \\n              1966, to promote transportation safety by conducting \\n              independent accident investigations and developing safety \\n              recommendations.  On 1 April 1975, the NTSB was \\n              re-established as a separate, independent agency by Title \\n              III of the Transportation Safety Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. \\n              1901).  Under the act, the board is authorized to: \\n \\n              (1)  Investigate transportation accidents; \\n \\n              (2)  Determine the probable cause of the accidents; \\n \\n              (3)  Make recommendations to the SECDOT or heads of \\n                   operating agencies for preventing or investigating \\n                   accidents, or for otherwise promoting safety; and \\n \\n                                 11-9 '}, vector=None),\n",

Description A fire hose is a basic fire fighting tool.  Although taken for granted, hoses are \\nhighly developed tools that must be properly used and maintained.\\nA standard fire hose is a double-jacketed, cotton or nylon-impregnated, \\nrubber-lined, orange hose.  It comes in 2 common diameters, 1½-inch or 2½-\\ninch, and is produced in standard lengths of 50 feet.  In some cases, a fire hose \\non smaller boats must be shorter than the standard length because of limited \\nspace.   In many cases the fire hoses available on boats are a bit different than \\nthe standard  double-jacketed, cotton or nylon-impregnated, rubber-lined, hose \\nyou see firefighters using.  It is a double jacketed, soft, nitrile rubber covered \\nhose. The fire hose is used in conjunction with a dewatering pump and \\nprovides limited fire fighting capability.\\nCAUTION!\\nE.2. Safety \\nPrecautionsBefore using a fire hose, several safety checks must be performed.  These \\nchecks may seem needlessly time-consuming at a fire scene.  Nonetheless, \\nthey must be performed to prevent a malfunction in a hose system that could \\ncause even more time to be lost.  The following checks should be performed:\\n(01)Make certain all hose connections are tight and a hose is free of kinks \\nand twists. \\n(02)Ensure the bail on a nozzle is closed before a hose is charged.\\n(03)Never lay a hose on an excessively hot deck. \\n(04)Be sure there are enough people available to control a fire hose before \\ncharging it.  Never leave a charged hose unattended.\\nA charged hose has considerable force.  Ensure it is properly manned at all times to prevent it from \\nswinging out of control.'}, vector=None),\n",

You practice.   \\n  You learn traffic signs, signals and rules.  You gain skill through  \\n  experience.  You learn to use common sense and good judgement. \\n \\n          Well, boating requires no less.  On today\\'s crowded waterways it  \\n  is too hazardous to learn by trial and error.  One of the essential  \\n  ingredients to boating safety is marine Rules of the Road. \\n \\n          As a responsible skipper, you have a duty to know these rules  \\n  fully and to observe them.  Their primary purpose is to prevent  \\n  collisions on the water.  The Coast Guard Auxiliary points out that if  \\n  you fail to observe the rules, and a mishap results, the plea that \\n  you did not know them is not a valid legal defense. \\n \\n          There are three basic boating situations which could risk  \\n  collision.  In each, your vessel will either be \"burdened\" or  \\n  privileged.\"  The burdened boat always is required to change course and  \\n  yield the right-of-way to the privileged boat. \\n \\n          You\\'ll be in either (1) a meeting situation, (2) a crossing  \\n  situation, or (3) an overtaking situation, when risk of collision is  \\n  possible.  (There are differing sets of Rules of the Road for different  \\n  parts of the nation.  Boaters should learn the applicable local rules.) \\n \\n          Boaters sometimes can be confused in a head-on meeting situation  \\n  with another vessel.  When two boats under power meet each other, neither  \\n  one has right-of-way.  Both boats must alter course to starboard (right)  \\n  sufficiently to allow safe passage of the other vessel on the port (left)  \\n  side. \\n \\n          In a crossing situation, the vessel on your starboard side is  \\n  always the privileged boat.  As the burdened vessel, you are obligated  \\n  to alter course and allow the other boat to pass safely. \\n \\n          In an overtaking situation, the burdened vessel always is the  \\n  boat which is passing.  In most instances, the passing boat should  \\n  overtake the other vessel on the portside.  In open water, you also may  \\n  pass on the starboard side.  A single blast on your horn indicates to the \\n  other skipper that you intend passing your port.  Two blasts indicates  \\n  you are passing to your starboard side. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nENC 2-13 '}, vector=None),\n",

The NMC, or its designated representative, may suspend the course approval, require the surrender of the certificate of approval and/or direct the approval holder to cease claiming the course is Coast Guard approved.  Upon suspension, the NMC is to verify that the approval holder has been notified how the course failed to meet applicable requirements and explain how deficiencies may be corrected.  The NMC may suspend the approval for up to 60 days to cure the deficiencies cited. If the training organization considers the suspension to be unwarranted, they may appeal the decision to the respective Coast Guard Distri ct Commander.  If the training \\norganization elects, they may reapply for a new approval of the suspended course prior to the end of suspension, emphasizing their new operating standards, through the National Maritime Center.

Withdrawal Of Approval .  \\nWithdrawal of an approved course can be applied, but not limited to the following: if found in violation of the regulations pertaining to the conduct of an approved course, or if the school ceases operation, or ceases to offer the course, or if there has been a determination that the approval holder has demonstrated a pattern or history of failing to comply with applicable regulations or the requirements of course approval, or substantially deviates from the approved course curricula, or presents the courses in a manner that is unsatisfactory or not conducive to achieving the specified learning objectives, or actions by instructors or training organization staff members contributing to the falsification of student documents or inappropriate issuance of a course completion certificate, or unauthorized modification of a course without having filed a request or provided appropriate notification, or prompting the students to give correct answers during an  examination, or the coaching of students to correctly \\nperform a demonstration during a performance -based assessment.

Afternoon \\nWind IncreasesMembers of the boating public often get underway in the calm waters of the \\ncool early morning.  By afternoon, when they try to get home, the bay or ocean \\nis so choppy that they may find themselves in need of assistance.  The wind \\nchanges so drastically because the sun warms the earth.  The land warms faster \\nthan the surface of the water and radiates heat to the overlying air, warming it. \\nThis warm air rises, reducing the atmospheric pressure in that area.  The air \\noffshore over the ocean is cool, and cool air is dense and heavy.\\nThe cool air from offshore flows inland in an attempt to equalize the pressure \\ndifferential caused by the rising warm air.  This flow produces wind, known \\nas sea breeze.  After sunset, the inland area cools more quickly than the water, \\nand the wind diminishes.\\nSea breezes typically reach their highest speeds during the period of maximum \\nheating (i.e., during mid- afternoon).  In some areas a land breeze can be \\nestablished late at night or early in the morning.  For this breeze to occur, the \\nsea surface temperature must be higher than the air temperature over land, \\nalong with weak winds prior to the breeze.\\nNOTE\\nA.3.

The primary responsibility to protect participants \\n      and spectators from the hazards of the event (including other \\n      participants) rests with the regatta sponsor.

Division captains usually have the job of presiding at\\nformal social and ceremonial functions sponsored by the\\ndivision, and at times may be invited to attend sinitar\\nfunctions given by other Auxiliary units or outside\\norganizations. These formar activities incrude changes of\\nwatch, changes of command, dinners, award banquets,\\nluncheons, and at times, social affairs in a personrs home.\\non those occasions where one is a guest, it is customary to\\npersonally greet the host and hostess as soon as possible\\nafter arriving. At the conclusion of the function it is also\\ncommon courtesy to again personally express appreciation to\\nthe host and hostess for being invited, before departing.\\nWhen a senior officer is present such as the district\\ncommodore or district commander, it is considered proper to\\ndelay leaving until they have paid respects and departed.\\nWhen a senior officer, such as the district commodore or\\ndistrict commander arrives and their presence is announced,\\nit is customary to stand briefly out of courtesy.\\n2.

When\\npassing through the line it is considered discourteous to\\ncarry food, beverage, cigarette, etc. It is also customary\\nto limit one's conversation with persons in the receiving\\nIine, so other people passing through the line will not have\\nto wait. Individuals entering the line, state their name\\ndistinctly to the first official member of the tine, usually\\nthe person acting as an aide.

When guests are introduced, it is important that their\\nnames and titles be correctly stated. Lengthy introductions\\nshould be avoided as they might be embarrassing to a guest or\\nspeaker, especially if they already know most of the other\\npeople present. Except for the principal speaker, or a\\ndistinguished guest, the only requirement for introduction is\\nname and title.

(cont\\'d) documentation, such as a Report of Violation, \\n            Form CG-2636, is prepared.  A Marine Safety Information \\n            System (MSIS) MVRR entry is made when required. \\n            Documentation, evidence, and other material on the \\n            incident, are forwarded to the district (program manager) \\n            in which the alleged violation occurred.  When an agency \\n            other than the Coast Guard conducts the investigation, \\n            that agency\\'s investigative report should be forwarded as \\n            part of the violation case.  When an early determination \\n            is made that an investigation might be better conducted by \\n            another Coast Guard district, or unit of that district, \\n            and the other district has been consulted, the initial \\n            report and other information on the incident may be \\n            forwarded without preparation of a Report of Violation. \\n \\nb.  Preparation Of Civil Penalty Cases .  Upon receipt of a violation case, the  \\n    district program manager evaluates it to determine whether there is sufficient  \\n    evidence to establish a \"prima facie\" (i.e., all elements of the violation are  \\n    shown) civil penalty case.  Care must be taken to ensure that all of the evidence  \\n    in support of the case is present, i.e., the facts available for development of  \\n    key conclusions should accompany those conclusions.  If the program manager  \\n    determines that a prima facie civil penalty case exists that warrants assessment  \\n    of a civil penalty, the case should be prepared and submitted to the hearing  \\n    officer.  These evaluations and submissions should be made in accordance with  \\n    current program guidelines. The district program manager may close a violation  \\n    case any time prior to its forwarding to the hearing officer; for example, this  \\n    might occur with the issuance of a district commander\\'s Letter of Warning, or due  \\n     to the party\\'s participation in the Marine Safety Reporting Program (MSRP).  When  \\n    possible, program managers should advise originating units of the disposition of \\n    their cases, including the reasons for the actions taken in each case. \\n        c.  Civil Penalty Case Files .  Each civil penalty case should \\n            be established and maintained as a separate case file \\n            (folder).  A case can have any number of alleged \\n            violations.

These \\nhours and tasks will not be counted toward the current year currency \\nmaintenance requirements.   \\n  \\nRecertifi cation  Members who go into REYR, for whatever reason, are considered as \\ntrainees until they correct the problem that placed them in REYR. \\nA member who fails to meet annual currency requirements for the year shall make up the missing hours and/or currency m aintenance tasks  as a \\ntrainee, under the supervision of a certified coxswain the following \\ncalendar year. (Ex #1. If the member only completes 4 hours the previous \\nyear, they must complete 8 hours as a trainee to regain certification)  (Ex \\n#2.

The authority to issue regulations to promote the \\n          safety of life on navigable waters during regattas and marine \\n          parades is contained in 33 USC 1233-1236.  It was assigned to \\n          the Commandant under Reorganization Plan No. 3, effective 16 \\n          July 1946.  Regulations addressing regattas and marine \\n          parades are promulgated in 33 CFR 100 to provide effective \\n          control over regattas and marine parades conducted on the \\n          navigable waters of the United States so as to insure safety \\n          of life in the regatta or marine parade area.  As with any \\n          regulations, the person issuing the rules must ensure \\n          compliance with NEPA and other applicable environmental laws. \\n          Events of major importance should be scheduled well in \\n          advance.  Early conferences should be held to permit public \\n          hearings, and to provide extensive notice to commercial \\n          interests regarding any special local regulations developed \\n          for the event.  Other federal, state, or civil agencies \\n          should also be kept informed of developments that might \\n          affect their plans or impinge upon their authority.  In those \\n          ports or waterways serviced by a VTS, the VTS should also be \\n          included in the planning, coordination, and review of the \\n          event permit.

Current Current is the horizontal flow or movement of water in a river.  Maximum \\ncurrent occurs during runoff and/or high water and the greatest velocity is in \\nthe area of the channel.  Restricted or narrow channels tend to have a venturi \\neffect, in that rushing water squeezes into a passage and accelerates.  Current \\nin a bend will tend to flow away from the inside point (to the outside), creating \\neddies, counter currents, and slack water immediately past the point.  This \\neffect will build shoals at the point or inside a bend.  The prudent operator will \\nbe alert to the changing current within a waterway. \\nI.5. Extremely \\nNarrow \\nChannelsIn extremely narrow channels where bank cushion and bank suction are \\nexpected, the coxswain should proceed at a very slow speed, keeping near the \\nmiddle of the channel and passing other boats closer than normal.  In a meeting \\nsituation in a narrow channel, headway should be reduced but not enough to \\nlose steerage.  On approaching the boat, a small amount of right rudder should \\nbe applied to head slightly toward the bank.  Shortly after passing the other \\nboat, the coxswain should reverse the rudder and straighten up.  A little right \\nrudder may be needed to hold course against the bank cushion effect.  Because \\nof wash from passing boats, extreme caution should be used. \\nTurning in a Bend  \\nI.6. Strengths \\nand WeaknessesBank suction, bank cushion, currents and wind are factors that affect a boat’s \\nturn in a sharp bend in a narrow channel.  Bank cushion and bank suction are \\nstrongest when the bank of a channel is steep.  They are weakest when the \\nedge of a channel shoals gradually and extends into a large area.  Bank suction \\nand bank cushion increase with the boat’s speed.  Channel currents are usually \\nstrongest in the bend with eddies or counter-currents and shoaling on the lee \\nside of the point.  Speed of the current is greater in deeper water than in shallow \\nwater. \\nI.7. Following \\nCurrent In a following current, the boat makes good speed with little help from the \\nengines.  When making a sharp turn with a following current, it is possible to \\nmake the following maneuvers: \\n(01) Hugging the point,\\n(02) Staying in the bend, \\n(03) Proceeding on thebend side, middle of the channel. \\nAn experienced operator can accomplish any of the three; however, the third \\nchoice, called the “bend side, middle of the channel,” is the safest, and \\ntherefore, the preferred choice. \\n '}, vector=None),\n",

Metering Methods  \\n  \\n          There are four ways for metering the combination of f-stop and  \\n          shutter speed, depending upon the sophistication of the camera  \\n          that you are using. \\n  \\n          a.  Programmed :  The camera selects both f-stop and shutter  \\n              speed automatically, this is typical of the newer  \\n              \"point-and-shoot\" cameras on the market today.  Some of  \\n              these will even fire the built in flash if the lighting is \\n              poor enough to warrant it. \\n  \\n          b.  Automatic :  One of the two settings is selected by the  \\n              camera.  \"Aperture preferred\" selects the shutter speed when  \\n              you set the f-stop.  \"Shutter preferred\" selects the f-stop  \\n              when you select the shutter speed. \\n  \\n          c.  Metered Manual :  You use the camera\\'s meter and exposure  \\n              indicator as you adjust the f-stop and shutter speed. \\n  \\n          d.  Manual:  Settings are determined without the camera\\'s  \\n              meter. \\n  \\n      5.  Exposure Guidelines  \\n  \\n          a.  Color Slide Film :  Control exposure as precisely as  \\n              possible.  Measure the light intensity by the highlights on  \\n              the subject.  Overexposure will bleach out the picture. \\n  \\n          b.  Color Print Film :  When in doubt overexpose.  Measure  \\n              intensity of light by the shadows on the subject.  If you \\n              are unsure of what setting to select, walk up to the subject,  \\n              and if possible, measure the light reflected off the surface,  \\n              then back away, using that exposure.  Your camera manual \\n              will provide details for how to do this. \\n \\n  H.  Depth of Field  \\n  \\n      Depth of field is defined as the distance between the nearest and the  \\n      farthest point of acceptable sharpness in the scene to be  \\n      photographed.  It may be considered the area in front of the camera  \\n      within which all subjects or objects appear in acceptable focus. \\n  \\n      Most interchangeable lenses have depth of field scales marked on the  \\n      lens barrel.  Using this scale will add another creative dimension  \\n      to your picture taking. \\n  \\n      1.

(2014)  \\nRecognizing that the majority of maritime casualties involve human error, the \\nInternational Maritime Organization is undertaking a review of its instruments, including \\nconventions, codes and resolutions, to consider whether human factor implications have adequately been taken into account in the development of guidelines, standards and recommendations.  The United States is playing a major role in this effort to integrate \\nhuman factors considerations into the IMO decision- making process.  The objective is to \\nensure that human performance limitations, and the role of the human being within a  \\ndefined system, are given fundamental consideration in the development of new international standards.  Given the rapidity with which new information is becoming available on human factors applications in the maritime environment, it is not possible to '}, vector=None),\n",

Certain vessels are exempted from some of the requirements by 46 U.S.C. 8701.  Refer to the statute for specific exemption limitations applicable to most fishing industry vessels, barges, yachts, sailing school vessels,  oceanographic research vessels, and mobile \\noffshore drilling units (MODU).

(2017 ) \\n \\n2. Crew Complement .  (2014)  \\nAlthough there are no statutes that mandate specific numbers of ratings on a U.S. merchant vessel, the minimum safe manning levels established by the OCMI must appropriately account for the operational requirements of the vessels and the impact of laws, and international treaties, which may imply or indirectly require the assignment of unlicensed seamen to the crew.  On oceangoing vessels, the number of unlicensed personnel carried must be sufficient for the watch provisions of 46 U.S.C. 8104 and 46  CFR 15.705.\\n  46 U.S.C. 8702 requires at least 75 percent of the crew in each department to \\nbe able to understand orders spoken by the officers. Additionally, 65 percent of the unlicensed deck crew must hold MMCs endorsed as able seaman; except vessels authorized to employ a 2- watch system may reduce the percentage to 50 percent.  \\n  \\n3. Citizenship Requirements.   (2014)  \\nAlthough a foreign national, e.g., a n alien lawfully admitted to the United States for \\npermanent residence, may obtain a MMC, 46 U.S.C. 8103 imposes specific citizenship requirements for U.S. vessels that may significantly limit the number of aliens that may be employed on such vessels .  Spe cifically, Section 8103(b) states that each unlicensed \\nseaman must be a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, and not more than 25 per cent of the total number of unlicensed seamen on the v essel may be permanent resident aliens.   (See Chapter B1  for a \\nmore detailed discussion of the citizenship requirements.)  \\n \\n4. Seagoing And Great Lakes Merchant Vessels Of More Than 100 GRT .  (2014, 2017 ) \\nSection 8104(d) provides that the unlicensed sailors  and oilers  on seagoing and Great \\nLakes vessels of more than 100 GRT must be divided into at least three watches.  Section 8104(g) modifies this requirement in that it allows a 2 -watch system to be employed on \\ntowing vessels, OSVs, and barges engaged on voyages of less than 600 nautical miles.   \\n \\nNOTE:   The Howard Coble Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014, Sec. \\n316, removed exclusions of various engineering ratings from performing their duties \\nwithin a two -watch system.

Posters \\n  \\n          Each Auxiliary-prepared poster has room for time, date, location,  \\n          and a personal contact person for the event being publicized.  It  \\n          is recommended that plain block lettering  be used.  This  \\n          style is easiest to read, and will be legible from the greatest \\n          distance. \\n  \\n          a.  Special Events :  Posters for special events, such as  \\n              boat shows or a public appearance will need to be developed  \\n              personally.  There are a great many aids available if you  \\n              decide to \"build your own\" poster. \\n  \\n          b.  Poster Materials :  Check the local stationery or business  \\n              products store.  There are a great many graphic products  \\n              available today to use for artistic endeavors.  Pressure  \\n              sensitive lettering, for instance, is available in many  \\n              sizes and colors, giving a professional appearance to \\n              your printed message. \\n  \\n      2.

SEATING OF GUESTS.\\n1. The seating of guests at a structured division social or\\nceremonial function is perhaps one of the least understood\\nresponsibilities of the division captain. Of greatest\\nconcern is the proper procedure for seating guests at a head\\ntable. The nurnber of guests to be seated at the head table\\nshould not exceed the total number of attendees at other\\ntables. For a division affair, such as a Change of Watch\\nDinner or an Awards Banquet it is recommended that the\\nmaximum number of guests seated at the head table be limited\\nto ten (10). These would normally include the division\\ncaptain and spouse, and eight of the most distinguished\\ninvited guests and their spouses. If there are more than\\nthis number of invited guests, such as past division\\ncaptains, officers of local Coast Guard units, civilian\\ndignitaries, etc. they may be seated at honors tables located\\non the main floor directly in front of the head table.\\n2. Division financial considerations wiII usually determine\\nhow many of non-paying guests are to be invited. Among those\\nwho might be considered as guests for a division function\\nare, the district commodore and/or the district vice\\ncommodore; the district director and/or the assistant\\ndistrict director; the district rear commodore of the area in\\nwhich the divisi-on is located, and the commanders of local\\nCoast Guard orgranizations. At times, the chief of the\\ndistrict boating safety division and a special guest speaker\\nmay be included among honored guests.\\n3. The seating of guests at the head table is made\\nrelatively easy if an attempt is made to follow protocol and\\nprecedence. The preferred arrangement for a division\\nfunction is to t'mix and matchtr guests and their spouses when\\ndeveloping the seating plan. This permits persons at the\\nhead table to meet, talk and becone better acquainted. An\\nacceptable alternative is to seat guests and their spouses\\ntogether next to other couples at the table. Regardless, the\\ndivision captain usually occupies the center seat at the\\ntable with distinguished guests and their spouses seated,\\nalternately right and left on each side, following precedence\\nof rank and/or position. Under the provisions of protocol,\\nspouses are treated with status comparable to that accorded\\nthe guest with then. To avoid the seating of a lady at the\\nend of a head table it is permissible to seat two ladies next\\nto each other, regardless of seating arrangement used.\\n3-8\\n\"}, vector=None),\n",

There are two types of suspect alerts that can be \\nreceived by U.S. RCCs:   \\n(1) U.S. Coded Distress Beacon  Suspect MEOSAR  Alert : U.S. RCCs may  receive  \\ndistress  alerts for U.S. coded distress beacons in the U.S.  SRR that contain a  \\ncautionary  note “suspect.” Suspect alerts shall be  distributed as an unlocated  first \\nalert message.  For U.S. coded distress beacons, only  suspect  alerts with associated  \\nbeacon registration data shall  be distributed.  \\n(2) Foreign Coded Distress Beacon Suspect MEOSAR Alert : In the event a suspect \\nalert is generated for a foreign coded distress beacon with encoded location wit hin \\nthe U.S. SRR, the alert will be distributed to the U.S. RCC based on the encoded \\nlocation.  The alert will only be sent to a foreign RCC associated with the distress \\nbeacon country code if the foreign RCC is  outside  of the U.S. service  area (i.e., \\nsuspect alerts  are not sent to U.S. SPOCs),  the associated MCC  for the foreign \\nRCC has a corroborating  alert,  or the foreign  RCC  receives  suspect alerts  from  its \\nassociated  MCC  based  on national  procedures.  The U.S. RCC shall contact the \\nforeign RCC to  determine  whether  distress beacon  registration information is  \\navailable.  \\n(3) Initially, all suspect  alerts shall be  considered in the  Alert Phase. When a  \\nMEOSAR alert is identified  as suspect, the  RCC shall  proceed  with caution  since  \\nthe beacon  HEX  ID and/or associated  encoded position may  be unreliable.  If the  \\nvalidity  of suspect  alerts  can be substantiated  by corroborating  information,  the \\nsuspect alert  can be  elevated to the Distress Phase.  Additional information that \\ncan assist in determining  the validity  of a suspect  alert includes the following:  \\na. Beacon  registration  data for the specific  beacon  HEX  ID. \\nb. An encoded vessel or  aircraft  ID (i.e. MMSI, Aircraft 24 Bit Address, aircraft  \\noperator  designator,  radio  call sign or tail  number).  \\nc. Correlation be tween the reported detection frequency  and the beacon model  \\ndetection frequency  that is associated  with its Cospas -Sarsat  type approval \\nnumber.  \\nd. Another  alert for the same  beacon  HEX  ID. \\n(h) Unreliable  406 MHz  Distress  Beacon  Alert  Message:  \\n(1) An unreliable message  may be produced  due to a  variety  of factors including  \\ntechnical problems with the  beacon,  satellite,  LUT, MCC, or MCC communications \\nnetworks.  In the event a  distress  beacon  alert is considered unreliable, no message  \\nfields  will be  decoded, and  the distress alert will include an  additional cautionary  \\nnote immediately  preceding  the standard message  title indicating, “UNRELIABLE  \\nBEACON  (HEXADECIMAL)  ID.” \\n(2) However, receipt of an unreliable distress alert does not imply  the absence  of \\ndistress.  The di stress  signal  may be valid  despite  the fact that the  beacon  message \\nmay be corrupt.  The distress  alert and associated  DOA  or Doppler  independent \\nlocation may  still be valid despite  the unreliable  nature  of the  message  itself.  '}, vector=None),\n",

Background.    \\nThe Coast Guard's policy with respect to maritime training is changing as a result of several \\ninfluences. These include the development of new technology, obligations resulting from the implementation of th e Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW), and the \\neconomic realities faced by both the Coast Guard and the maritime industry.  Labor saving technological advances have resulted in smaller crews and the elimination of traditional appre ntice/training billets.  STCW requires mariners to demonstrate practical proficiency, as \\nwell as knowledge, prior to the issuance of documents and licenses. The Coast Guard is required to meet its responsibilities regarding marine safety and environmental protection with fewer resources each year. The maritime industry needs to operate its vessels in the most cost effective manner possible while also meeting its obligation to employ well trained, competent mariners using clearly defined and understood proce dures to safely operate the vessels.  Well \\ndesigned training programs, including the integration of simulators, can provide the mariner with a quality training experience.  \\n \\nB. Requirements.    \\n The Coast Guard will consider granting approval of a course or tra ining program for one of the \\nfollowing reasons:  \\n 1. The course is required by regulation.  \\n 2. The course substitutes for part of the sea service required for issuance of licenses and certificates.  \\n 3. The satisfactory completion of a course is substituted for a required examination.  \\n \\nC. Course Approval Application Procedures.  \\n 1. The course approval process is explained in Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 10, Subpart C (46 CFR 10.301 -  10.304).  An organization desiring to have a course \\napproved by the Coast Guard must submit a Course Curriculum Package to the Commanding Officer, National Maritime Center (NMC -4B) at 4200 Wilson Blvd.; Suite \\n510; Arlington, VA 22203- 1804. \\n 2. Course approval submissions must document that the course covers the material neces sary \\nto satisfy regulatory training requirements.  Specific course guidelines produced and used by the Coast Guard for the review of approved courses are discussed below and may be obtained through the Internet via the Marine Safety Web site at www:uscg.mi l/hq/g -\\nm/gmhome.htm or by writing the Commanding Officer, National Maritime Center (NMC -\\n4B).

[NOTE: The term \"general \\n           anchorage\" is frequently used as a synonym for \\n           \"anchorage grounds,\" but this usage is incorrect.  A \\n           general anchorage is an area not designated \\n           specifically for anchoring for special purposes such \\n           as quarantine, lightering, or transferring \\n           explosives.] Guidance on establishing anchorage \\n           grounds is found in COMDTINST M16704.2 Series. \\n        \\n       4.  Enforcement Activities .  Insofar as practicable, the \\n           COTP should maintain a listing of vessels in the \\n           anchorage grounds in the COTP zone.  This can be \\n           facilitated by agreements with local pilots\\' \\n           associations and maritime exchanges.  COTPs should \\n           check vessels present in an anchorage ground to ensure \\n           that they meet the criteria for that anchorage ground \\n           under 33 CFR 110.  VTS\\'s, where established, may \\n           assist the COTP in anchorage administration. \\n        \\n           a.  Enforcement Patrols .  To allow a close inspection \\n               of anchored vessels, boat patrols of the anchorage \\n               grounds are preferable.  This is one function of \\n               the harbor patrol as outlined in subparagraph B.2. \\n               Boat crews should be thoroughly familiar with the \\n               regulations covering each anchorage ground they \\n               are to patrol.  Supervisory personnel should be \\n               proficient in piloting and navigation to the \\n               extent that, if a discrepancy is believed to \\n               exist, a fix of the vessel or vessels involved can \\n               be obtained in the event violations are detected. \\n        \\n           b.  Enforcement Records .  A record of each vessel \\n               using the anchorage ground is of great help in \\n               controlling anchorage and enforcing anchorage \\n               regulations.  These records are not required, but \\n               they are strongly encouraged in high traffic \\n               density ports where the majority of users are not \\n               local vessels.

This is done by entering the graph in Figure H -21 from \\nthe left with the POD value, moving right to the “normal search conditions POD \\ncurve then down to the horizontal axis to get the equivalent “normal search \\nconditions” coverage.  Once all coverage values have been referenced to the \\n“normal search conditions” POD curve, t hey may be added to get an equivalent \\n“cumulative coverage” and used like any other coverage to get the cumulative POD \\nfrom the “normal search conditions” POD curve.  \\nc. If the “cumulative coverage” is greater than 3.0 and therefore off the graph in Figure \\nH-21, the formula for the “normal search conditions” POD curve is  \\nC\\nNormal e POD\\uf02d\\uf02d\\uf03d1\\n \\nwhere e is the base of the natural logarithms.  Most scientific hand -held calculators \\nhave an “exponential function” or “EXP” key that computes the value of ex where \\nx is the value entered by the user.  Simply enter the coverage or cumulative coverage \\nas a negative number, press the “EXP” or “ ex ” key and subtract the result from 1.0 \\nto get the POD or cumulative POD.  \\n(2) A high Cumulative POD for subsequent searches of an area without locating the search \\nobject may indicate the object was not in or has moved out of the search area, has sunk, \\nor has changed characteristics and requires a reevaluation of search area and coverage \\n(e.g., primary target changes from a fishing  vessel to a liferaft).   \\n(d) For searches involving multiple resources, the total available effort and the optimal search \\nfactor, area, coverage factor and track spacing are computed using the procedures given in \\nChapter 4 and Appendix L of the IAMSAR Man ual.  This coverage factor may be used with \\nthe appropriate curve of Figure H -21 to determine POD for the total area searched. If the \\nsearch is unsuccessful, the search area should be expanded, using the procedures given in \\nChapter 4 and Appendix L of the IAMSAR Manual . The POD for that particular search may \\nbe determined as before.  \\n(e) Inland search POD is discussed in the IAMSAR Manual  and the National SAR Supplement . \\n \\nH.5.6.3 Probability of Containment  (POC ) is described as the probability that the search object(s) \\nare contained in a particular area. POC values for rectangles centered on the datum position(s) \\nmay be inferred from the assumed distribution of possible search object positions around the \\ndatum(s) . In order to estimate POS for a search it is necessary to have an estimate of the \\nPOC for the search area.  Figure H -22 shows a graph of PO C vs. Search Factor ( fs) for single \\npoint and divergent datums.  The search radius R is the product of the search fa ctor and the \\ntotal probable error of position ( R = fs x E). \\n(a) The optimal search factor curves in the IAMSAR Manual  were computed for single point \\ndatum (square) search areas but are used for both single and divergent datums  for the sake \\nof simplicity and because the loss of POS for divergent datums is generally small when \\ncompared to the “true” optimal value.  It may be possible to improve the POS slightly in \\nthe case of divergent datums by modifying the search factor somewh at.

Consequently, the quality of the results often is \\nnot substantially better than could be obtained with pencil and paper.  Another tool in use \\nprior to 2007 was the Computer Assisted Sea rch Planning (CASP) system . CASP used a \\nsimulation approach  but it was outdated and had some serious limitations that could not be \\novercome without a complete re -design .  Consequently, the Search and Rescue Optimal \\nPlanning System (SAROPS) was developed to replace both JAWS and CASP.  SAROPS \\nwas fielded for operational use in 2007 and it is currently  the only search planning software  \\nfor maritime SAR  that uses the simulation approach .  The main advantage of simulation is \\nthat it allows a more realistic representation of real -world compl exity than the grossly over -\\nsimplified manual method.   SAROPS is more comprehensive and sophisticated than any of \\nits predecessors, addresses many of their limitations and shortcomings, and is easier to use.   \\n \\nH.1.3  Search Planning Variables  \\nSearch planning is based on myriad variables including environmental factors, the nature, \\ntime and location of the  distress incident, the type(s) of search object(s) resulting from the \\ndistress, and the available search platforms and their capabilities, in cluding the time at which \\nthey can be on scene.  The variables whose values ultimately determine where to place the \\nsearch area over a given time  period , as well as its size and orientation, are those variables \\nneeded to estimate a probability density dist ribution describing where search objects are \\nmore likely and less likely to be during the time when search facilities can be on scene , plus \\nthe variables needed to estimate the available search effort (Z)  during  that time.  In the \\nmanual method, the probability density distribution was estimated by computing one or two \\ndrift trajectories to obtain datum positions and then assuming the probability density was \\ndistributed around those datums according to a specific distribution  function from statistics.  \\nThis function was a circular bivariate normal distribution whose size was characterized by \\nthe total probable error of position  (E). By definition, there was a 50% probability of \\ncontainment ( POC ) within a radius of E from a dat um position, or more generally, if n \\ndatums were computed, the POC within the probable error of each datum was 50%/ n.  A \\ntacit and unrealistic assumption of the manual method was that search objects do not move \\nwhile SRUs are on scene searching.   \\nH.1.3.1  Whether using the manual method or a computer simulation like SAROPS, e stimating a \\nprobability density distribution for planning a search  requires the following information:  \\n(a) The list of search objects that may have been set adrift by the distress incid ent and the \\nleeway coefficients for those objects along with the uncertainties about the objects’ \\nleeway , which affects the ir range s of possible drift trajectories . \\n(b) An estimate of the distress incident’s date and time, and the distressed craft’s position \\nand positional uncertainty at that time.  \\n(c) The commence search date and time  and the estimated  duration of the search  epoch being \\nplanned . \\n(d) Wind and current data for the vicinity of the distress incident sufficient to cover any place \\nthe obje ct(s) may have drifted since the distress incident, along with uncertainties about \\nthe wind and current values.  \\nH.1.3.2  Estimating the available search effort (Z) requires the following information:  '}, vector=None),\n",

It may be considered a given that a PIW \\nevolution will bring the coxswain and crew to a higher sense of awareness. \\nHowever, due to the increased risk of operating a boat in heavy weather \\nconditions, special considerations must be given to the level of experience and \\nskill of the boat crew and the capabilities of the boat.

PIW \\nProcedureThe general PIW procedure is put in effect as soon as the alarm is sounded, \\nbut the nature of heavy weather/surf adds complications.  The coxswain may \\nbe required to enter the heavy weather/surf by positioningthe boat down swell \\nof the PIW and makingthe approach as discussed in this section.\\nC.2. Down Swell \\nRunIf needed, the turn to run down swell and approach will be planned differently \\nin heavy weather/surf.  The coxswain may not be able to turn the boat \\nimmediately after the alarm is given.  Doing so may expose the bow of the \\nboat to the swell enough that regaining control and getting the bow back into \\nthe seas might be very difficult.\\nThe coxswain will push ahead a safe distance from the person in the waterand \\nstation keep until the opportunity to turn presents itself.  The turn is not made \\nuntil the coxswain can do so without exposing the beam of the boat to the\\nbreaks or excessive swells.  This is avoided by timing the turn to correspond \\nwith the lull in the breaks.  Doing so allows the coxswain to take advantage of \\nany window that may develop.

The Coast Guard workforce is our top priority. We are  transforming our talent \\nmanagement system, investing in housing, healthcare, and childcare access, and investing in \\nour recruiting system to make Coast Guard service meaningful and rewarding, and to enhance mission execution. \\n  c.  We protect the Marine T ransportation System in our ports, on our inland rivers, and on \\nthe Great Lakes.  \\n  d.  We protect the safety of life at sea throughout U.S. waters – and especially along our maritime borders. Our crews are responding to a surge in maritime migration, many on cutters more than 50 years old.   e.  The impacts of climate change, our national security interests in the Polar Regions, and \\naging shore infrastructure all demand ac tion today. \\n  f.  We are a global Coast Guard.

Seating Arrang ements and Speaking Order \\nIntroduction Whenever guests are specifically invite d to attend functions  where seating is \\nprovided, whether it be a meeting, l uncheon, a dinner, or some other \\nsit-down activity, be certain that guests  know where they will be seated, and \\nif invited speakers, what order they will speak.  \\nG.1.  Head \\nTable If there is a head table for a meal a nd meal tickets are re quired, arrangements \\nshould be made with the serving personne l so that individuals at the head \\ntable are not required to present individua l tickets before being served.  It is \\nnot essential that all invite d guests be seated at the head table at a structured \\nfunction.  In some instances, where the number of distinguished guests \\nexceeds the available seating space at th e head table, or for various other \\nreasons, only a few of th e distinguished guests may be seated at the head \\ntable.  These should include at least the principal speaker  and senior Coast \\nGuard and Auxiliary personnel.  Other sp ecial guests may be seated at front \\ntables on the main floor of the dining area, or the spouses of the officers at \\nthe head table may be seated at specia l tables in the main dining area.  The \\ndistinguished guests may be seated at front tables on the main floor of the \\ndining area, and brought up to places at the head table at the start of the \\nprogram.  If this format is followed, the guests should be acknowledged at \\nthe beginning of the affair.  \\nG.2.  Socializing When invited as guests at a structured  function, most people enjoy meeting \\nthe other people present, particularly if they are not acquainted with the \\nmembership of the local group.  Either the host, or someone assisting as a \\nlocal host for guests at a structured f unction, have an unwritten obligation to \\nnot allow one person to monopolize the time of invited guests in lengthy \\nconversations, especially on subjects th at could become embarrassing.  In \\nsuch a situation, it is appropriate to interrupt the discussion in a courteous \\nmanner, either by asking the guest if you could have a few words, or simply \\nby taking someone else to the guest for an introduction.  \\n12-17  '}, vector=None),\n",

Otherwise, \\nuse the actua l OSE.  \\n(e) There is no need for a great deal of precision in the above computations.  Rough “eyeball” \\nestimates will do.  The goal is simply to avoid inputs that force SAROPS Planner to \\nproduce a search plan that wastes significant amounts of search effort  on regions  that have \\nlittle or no probability of containing the search object.  Such effort  could be better employed \\nin a subsequent search immediately following the first  search  if the first search should \\nprove unsuccessful.   It is not advisable to  force  Planner to produce search plans with much \\nsmaller track spacings than the SRU s can actually perform, although this issue has already \\nbeen addressed to some degree by providing the  minimum track spacing values that Planner \\nis allowed to use.  \\n(f) Another situation where the search planner may want to adjust the on scene endurance \\noccurs when the probability grid shows two or more “hot spots” of higher probability \\ndensity separated by some not too large distance and/or region of lower probability de nsity,  \\nand there is sufficient searching effort available to cover both of them reasonably well \\nduring a single sortie.  In this case, it may be prudent to make one actual SRU look like \\ntwo with  about half of its OSE assigned to each part.  For example, a single HH65 with 2.2 \\nhours OSE could be entered into SAROPS as 6501a  and 6501b  with one hour OSE each, \\nleaving 0.2 hours for transit between the first and second search areas.  The commence \\nsearch time (CST) values would also have to be adjusted accordingl y.  For example, if \\n6501a  had a CST of 1100Z, then 6501b  would have a CST of 12:12Z.  Such a split could \\nsignificantly improve the POS since otherwise SAROPS would either concentrate all of \\nthe available effort on just one of the “hot spots” or spread it o ut over both “hot spots” and '}, vector=None),\n",

Executive Order (E.O.) 11234 of 3 September \\n                   1980 designated the Coast Guard, the FCC, and the State \\n                   Department as the enforcing agencies of SOLAS.  The FCC \\n                   is responsible for the enforcement of federal laws \\n                   concerning required radio equipment and radio direction \\n                   finders on merchant vessels, except lifeboat portable \\n                   radios, which are within the cognizance of the Coast \\n                   Guard (lifeboat portable radios are inspected and \\n                   tested for the Coast Guard by the FCC).  47 U.S.C. 361 \\n                   authorities the FCC to issue Safety Radiotelegraphy \\n                   Certificates, Safety Radiotelephony Certificates, and \\n                   Exemption Certificates in regard to merchant vessel \\n                   radio requirements.  The radiotelegraphy and \\n                   radiotelephony certificates are issued directly by the \\n                   FCC; the Exemption Certificate, as other SOLAS \\n                   certificates, is issued by the Coast Guard to a \\n                   passenger vessel upon receipt of FCC Form 806 or other \\n                   verification that the vessel is in compliance with \\n                   SOLAS radio requirements. \\n \\n              (2)  English Language Standards .

Copies of the \\n                   resolution may be obtained from Commandant (G-OSR). \\n \\n      9.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) .  The purpose of the NRC \\n          is to ensure that civilian use of nuclear materials and \\n          facilities are conducted in a manner consistent with public \\n          health, safety, environmental quality, and national security. \\n          The NRC has a particular interest in the seaworthiness of barges \\n          used for the transportation and disposal at sea of radioactive \\n          wastes.  These barges are usually less than 100 gross tons (GT) \\n          and are not subject to certification.  The Coast Guard has \\n          agreed to cooperate with the NRC as follows: \\n \\n          a.  When requested, the Coast Guard will inspect a barge under \\n              100 GT used for disposal of radioactive waste.  The licensee \\n              or the carrier acting for a licensee will be advised of the \\n              Coast Guard\\'s findings.  The inspection will be made to \\n              determine the barge\\'s seaworthiness, structural condition, \\n              and its suitability for the intended operation; drydocking \\n              may be required. \\n \\n          b.  The OCMI shall forward copies of letters concerning \\n              inspection of such barges to Commandant (G-MVI) for record \\n              purposes, and to the regional NRC office having jurisdiction \\n              over the licensee.

In a similar manner, the same types \\n              of resources for federal operations described in subparagraph 7.B.4.a \\n              above should be used.  The OSC shall supervise the operation as \\n              generally described in subparagraph 7.B.4.c above. \\n  \\n          b.  Although there are some situations where the 311(k) Pollution Fund \\n              could also be used to fund removal costs (i.e., discharge of substance \\n              listed in 40 CFR 117 into navigable waters, the contiguous zone, or \\n              other offshore waters under FWPCA jurisdiction), the Coast Guard and \\n              EPA have agreed that, whenever possible, CERCLA will be used for a \\n              hazardous substance response.  In any case, the 311(k) fund shall not \\n              be used for response to hazardous substance incidents without prior \\n              Commandant (G-WER) approval. \\n  \\n          c.  Upon determining that a federal removal is necessary, the OSC must \\n              notify EPA Headquarters of the estimated costs, and obtain a CERCLA \\n              account number and document control numbers.  For incidents that occur \\n              after working hours and/or on weekends, the OSC should initiate \\n              necessary actions and contact EPA the next working day.  When \\n              notifying EPA, the OSC must provide information on the location and \\n              nature of the incident, and the nature of response activities to be \\n              performed.  Note that the OSC must obtain a new document control \\n              number for each contract initiated for a response and each subsequent \\n              modification (i.e., if five contractors are involved in a response, \\n              five document control numbers must be initially obtained from EPA). \\n              If the obligated amount for a contract is increased at a later date, \\n              another document control number must be obtained to account for the \\n              increase. \\n  \\n          d.  CERCLA encourages state and local response actions and can be used to \\n              provide reimbursement for certain actions described in Section 111 of \\n              the law when certified by the OSC.  The EPA (the administrator of the \\n              fund) establishes policies that govern what specific costs are \\n              reimbursable.  Any state that desires to enter into a contract or \\n              cooperative agreement to carry out response actions under CERCLA \\n              should be referred to the EPA. \\n  \\n      5.  Determining Removal Completeness . \\n  \\n          a.  As a general rule the OSC should pursue removal operations until: \\n  \\n              (1)  All environmental and public health and welfare concerns are \\n                   addressed, and the criteria for initiating a removal action no \\n                   longer exist; or \\n  \\n              (2)  Substantial cleanup techniques must be employed, after the \\n                   immediate and significant risk of harm to human health or the \\n                   environment has been abated, to complete the removal of remaining \\n                   contamination. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                     7-43 \"}, vector=None),\n",

Selecting A Theme :  Analyze the message you have in  \\n              mind.  This is a visual concept, and a cluttered space will  \\n              distract the viewer.  If the window space is small, select  \\n              one point or theme - CME, PE, Safe Boating Program - but  \\n              don\\'t try to do all three. \\n  \\n          c.  Attention-getting Techniques :  The most effective display  \\n              will have a central eye-catcher.  Branch off with smaller  \\n              items, then bring the observer\\'s eye back to the central  \\n              message.

Lighting :  Lighting can be very important also.   \\n              Adjustable spots can allow you to focus on specific areas,  \\n              and help to draw the eye around the display.

Prompt Removal :  Be sure to set up and take down promptly  \\n              at the store\\'s request.  They are providing you an important  \\n              service by giving up their own advertising.  Treat it with  \\n              respect. \\n  \\n          f.  Acknowledgement of Services :  Be sure to acknowledge the  \\n              cooperating store owner.  Pictures of the window in the local  \\n              newspaper, recognizing the store\\'s support in a public  \\n              announcement, a certificate of appreciation, any and all will  \\n              create good PR and usually an invitation to return. \\n  \\n  D.  Maintenance  \\n  \\n      All displays will require some maintenance.  Be sure to check the  \\n      condition of all displays before they are brought before the public\\'s  \\n      eye.

The Chief Director of Auxiliary ( CHDIRAUX, CG -BSX).    \\n \\nb. The Headquarters program manager for a Headquarters unit or their designee (e.g., the Director of Health, Safety , and Work- Life (CG -11) or the Chaplain of the Coast Guard \\n(CG-00A) ). \\n \\nc. The Area Commander or their designee (e.g., Area Chief of External Affairs ( CG-092)).  \\n \\nd. The District Commander or their designee (e.g., Chief of Prevention (dp), Director of Auxiliary (dpa), District Chaplain (dch), Sector Commander, unit Commanding Officer or Officer in Charge).  Note:  This does not preclude Auxiliary elected and appointed staff officers from assigning other Auxiliarists to duty in a ccordance with provisions of the \\nAuxiliary Manual , COMDTINST  16790.1 (series).  The DIRAUX should be consulted in \\nadvance of any such assignment if it entails travel outside the geographic area of responsibility (AOR) for an Auxiliarist’s region, interaction to any degree with the public, or as otherwise specified by the DIRAUX.  \\n \\n2.  In determining ATD authorization, all due consideration must be given to mission need and risk that may stem from fundamental Auxiliary demographics in determining whether  an assignment to \\nduty is warranted.  This still includes whether an Auxiliarist has been fully vaccinated or not.  \\nConsideration must also be given to an increase in boating accidents and fatalities stemming from the attractiveness and proliferation of recreational boating during the COVID -19 environme nt.  All \\nOIAs are therefore strongly encouraged to make thorough, accurate, and updated assessments of their operating environments (including incorporation of state/local guidance), fully leveraging the many best practices and lessons learned that have been compiled to mitigate COVID -19 risk.  They \\nshould also identify and act upon opportunities for Auxiliarists to re -engage with boaters across the \\nAuxiliary’s authorized recreational boating safety mission activities in order to help curtail these alarming  trends.  \\n 3.  Coast Guard c ommands, DIRAUXs, OIAs, lead Auxiliarists (coxswains, pilots, etc.) , Auxiliary \\nelected officers, and program managers (e.g., flotilla and division staff officers) are authorized to ask their Auxiliary crew members  and program pa rticipants  if they are fully vaccinated or not to \\ndetermine risk mitigation and to assist in determining ATD, and Personnel Protection Equipment (PPE)/social distancing requirements.   In addition, Coast Guard c ommands, DIRAUXs, OIAs, and \\nlead Auxiliarists  may terminate any ATD o f an Auxiliarist if they do not disclose their vaccination \\nstatus .  They may also require their Auxiliar y crews to take precautions to mitigate the spread of \\nCOVID- 19 by requiring mask, social distancing, etc.  Any issues or concerns are to be immediately \\nreferred to the OIA for resolution.  \\n \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

Drug Arrests Without Convictions.    \\nAbsent a conviction, admission of use or admission of addiction to dangerous drugs may \\nbe grounds for disqualifying an applicant for a license, COR or MMD.  A person may truthfully answer \"no\" to questions on the application concerning convictions, however, an arrest(s) may be an indicator that the applicant is or was a user of the dangerous drugs \\nindicated on the arrest record.  As such, they may prompt the evaluator to ask further questions to determine if the applicant was or is a drug user.  A delay in the issuance of a license or document p ending the results of a criminal records check may be encountered.  \\n \\nF. Alcohol Related Convictions.    \\nConvictions for driving while intoxicated/driving under the influence are considered to be \\nmore than minor traffic violations and reflect unfavorably on the applicant\\'s suitability to be \\nentrusted with the duties and responsibilities of the license.  They must be noted in Section VI \\nof the application, or by a separate notation on the application.  Applicants indicating \\nconviction(s) of vehicular crimes shall be assigned minimum or maximum assessment periods \\nin accordance with the regulations.  \\n \\n1. Driving While Intoxicated/Driving Under The Influence Of  Intoxicants (DWI/DUI).  \\nDWI/DUIs are serious matters and may indicate that an applicant should not be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of a license, MMD or COR.  Each applicant must be \\nevaluated on an individual basis to determine if the DWI/DUI conviction(s) is indicative of a deeper problem affecting the applicant\\'s qualification to hold a license, CO R or \\nMMD, or is the result of a single isolated failure of judgment.  In evaluating applicants with DWI/DUI convictions, the evaluator must qualify the applicant based on the \\nconvictions, taking into consideration the number and severity of the convictions , recency \\nof the convictions and evidence of rehabilitation/reform.  The following guidelines offer additional factors for evaluating the qualification of an applicant with DUI/DWI \\nconvictions.  \\n \\na. Single Conviction.    \\nA single DUI/DWI conviction within the p ast three years may indicate the early stage \\nof a developing, long- term problem, or that the individual having a well -developed \\nproblem was only caught once, or that this was an isolated incident of poor judgment.  The evaluator should attempt to identify which of the possible scenarios is applicable.  \\n (1) In cases where a long -term problem is developing and the conviction is over one \\nyear old, but less than three, the application should be processed unless a suspension or revocation is still in effect for a st ate driver\\'s license.  The \\napplicant should be put on notice, in a letter, that their license may be in \\njeopardy.  \\n (2) If the conviction is more than three years old, a conviction clearance is normally \\nnot necessary.

Soundings One of the more vital services a chart performs is to describe the bottom \\ncharacteristics to a boat operator. This is accomplished through the use of \\ncombinations of numbers, colorcodes, underwater contour lines, and a system \\nof symbols and abbreviations.\\nB.4.a  Datum The nautical chart water depth is measured downward from sea level at low \\nwater (soundings).  Heights or landmarks are given in feet above sea level.  In \\nthe interest of navigationsafety, the mean (or average)of the lower of the two \\ntides in the tidal cycle is used for soundings.\\nB.4.b. Mean Low \\nTideMost of the numbers on the chart represent soundings of the water depth at \\nmean low tide.  Datum refers to a base line from which a chart’s vertical \\nmeasurements are made.\\nB.4.c.  Mean \\nLow Water“Mean low water” is a tidal datum that is the average of all the low water \\nheights observed over the National Tidal Datum Epoch (19 year average).\\nB.4.d.

These lines are either numbered or\\ncoded, according to depth, using particular combinations of dots and dashes.  \\nDepth of water may be charted in feet, meters or fathoms (a fathom equals six \\nfeet).

Wide Fog Wide fog is applied with a vari-nozzle. Wide fog is a pressurized spray less \\npowerful than narrow fog.  Because wide fogcovers more area than narrow fog, \\nit may be used most effectively when it is possible to get right up next to the \\nfire.\\nWide water fog can also provide a heat shield by forming a screen of water \\ndroplets between a firefighter and the fire. When fire fighters are properly \\nclothed and hose lines have vari-nozzles, it is not necessary to use low-velocity \\nwater for personal protection. \\nFog streams us ed improperly can injure personnel.  The fog screen from \\nnarrow fog can obscure a nozzleman’s visibility.  This is extremely important \\nto remember when no opening exists in the compartment or passageway other \\nthan the opening through which the nozzle is being advanced.  In spaces with \\nonly one opening, heat and smoke can blow back or burst through or around a \\nfog curtain.  When circumstances require entering a compartment or \\npassageway that has only one opening, short bursts of solid stream or fog \\nshould be directed toward the overhead to knock down the flames. \\nUsing water as an extinguishing agent adds water and weight to a vessel. This \\ncan cause the vessel to become unstable. Normally, the water will be removed \\n(dewatered) after the fire has been extinguis hed. However, to maintain \\nstability and decrease the threat to the crew, the vessel should be dewatered as \\nsoon as possible. \\nF.6. Effectiveness\\n Water can be effective on all classes of fire, when properly applied for the \\nsituation.  However, it is most effective for Class A fires. It is recommended \\nfor use in Class D (combustible metals) fires for its cooling effect and ability \\nto wash the material away . \\nF.7. Adapting \\nEquipmentWhile the high velocity and low velocity fogs described above are effective, \\nit is important to remember that the limited fire fighting capability on most \\nboats requires some adaptation to ensure a fog is applied.  Since a fog stream \\nis essentially a stream of water that has been broken up into smaller droplets, \\nyou can use the equipment available to achieve this.  It could be as simple as \\nsplitting the water flow by hitting a rung on a ladder or by deflecting the \\nstream off a bulkhead or deck. \\n '}, vector=None),\n",

We hear about \"20# papers, 50#  \\n  papers, 80# papers, book bond, and cover papers\".  What does it all mean?   \\n  Actually that\\'s pretty simple, too.  Paper is generally classified into  \\n  six types:  Book (or Text), Bond, Index, Cover, Bristol , and \\n  Tag.  Each type paper has been assigned what is known as a  \\n  \"basis size\" .  These are \\n \\n                      Book (Text)          25\" X 38\" \\n                      Bond                 17\" X 22\" \\n                      Index                25.5\" X 30.5\" \\n                      Cover                20\" X 26\" \\n                      Bristol              22.5\" X 28.5\" \\n                      Tag                  24\" X 36\" \\n \\n  Each of these types of paper come in various standard weights.  The  \\n  most common are: \\n \\n                      Book (Text)          50#, 60#, 70#, 80#, 100# \\n                      Bond                 16#, 18#, 20#, 24# \\n                      Index                90#, 110#, 140# \\n                      Cover                65#, 80#, 100#                       Bristol              67#, 80#, 100#, 120#                       Tag                  100#, 125#, 150# \\n \\n          When they refer to a 20# Bond, they\\'re referring to a Bond paper  \\n  of which 500 sheets (or 1 ream) of the basis size (17\" X 22\") will weight  \\n  20#.  Paper is sold by the pound, so the r paper you specify, the   heavie\\n  higher the cost of your printing job ...  EXCEPT... LIGHTER PAPERS \\n  DO NOT FEED AS EASILY THROUGH THE PRESS.  So you can save money on paper \\n  and spend your savings, and more, in production costs!  Also, because \\n  of the various basis sizes, the weights are not consistent throughout the  \\n  types of paper.  For example, 24# Bond is heavier stock than 50# Book  \\n  (Text).  Actually, 20# Bond is pretty much the same as 50# Book paper,  \\n  while 24# Bond is the same as 60# Book paper. \\n \\n          Papers are made for different purposes too.  Bond, for  \\n  example, is a writing paper with a hard \"tinny\" surface.  This makes it  \\n  great to write on, but for printing quality, a Book (Text) paper is \\n  usually suited better to offset reproduction.  For purposes of the  \\n  Auxiliary, you\\'ll be using Bond for letterhead and envelopes, Book (Text)  \\n  for brochures, flyers, publications and the like, Cover for covers  \\n  (like the cover of the Navigator ), and Index for business cards. \\n \\n          Book (Text) paper comes in two main categories, \"coated\" and  \\n  \"uncoated.\"  \"Coated\" paper (usually referred to as \"Enamel\" stock) is  \\n  the nice shiny paper found in magazines \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nENC 3-3 '}, vector=None),\n",

DEEPWATER PORTS (DWP's) \\n  \\n  A.  Authority .  The authority for Department of Transportation (DOT) licensing and \\n      inspection of DWP's is contained in the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DPA), as \\n      amended (33 USC 1501 et seq.), and 33 CFR 148-150.  Licenses for a DWP are \\n      issued and signed by the Secretary of the Department of Transportation \\n      (SECDOT).  The SECDOT has delegated most regulatory responsibilities imposed \\n      by the DPA to the Commandant, including the processing of license \\n      applications.  The SECDOT has, however, retained the authority to issue, \\n      transfer, amend, or renew DWP licenses (49 CFR 1.44(o)(7)).  The Commandant \\n      has further delegated enforcement responsibility for DWP's to the captain of \\n      the port (COTP) where the DWP is located (33 CFR 1.01-30).  For information on \\n      DWP safety zones, see chapter 1 of this volume. \\n  B.  Coast Guard Responsibilities .

This process is extremely useful for small (a few hundred at  \\n  most) quantities.  However, the process is expensive on a \"per-piece\"  \\n  basis, the reproduction quality of type is not very good while picture  \\n  reproduction is poor, and there are limits to the types of paper that  \\n  can be used and the colors of ink pigments that are available. \\n \\n          Offset Lithography  is the most widely used form of printing  \\n  in our country today.  Based on the premise that oil and water don\\'t mix,  \\n  oil-based inks are transferred to an oil-receptive image on a \"plate.\"   \\n  The image is then \"offset\" or transferred to a hard rubber blanket, and \\n  the paper, when pressed against the blanket, receives the image (note  \\n  that plate and paper never meet, because the image is \"offset\" onto the  \\n  blanket).  Plates are generally made of either of two materials, paper  \\n  or metal. \\n \\n          Paper plates are usually made by \"direct image\" or \"Itek\"  \\n  process, where the image of the copy is transferred directly to the  \\n  plate.  Paper plates are inexpensive, quick to make, and do not print  \\n  with the quality of metal plates. \\n \\n          Metal plates are sheets of either aluminum (most common) or  \\n  steel, which have been coated with a light-sensitive plastic coating (or  \\n  photopolymer).  The copy or image is photographed in a large lithographic  \\n  camera, producing a film negative.  The negative, after it is developed, \\n  is pressed against the plate and exposed to an extremely bright light.   \\n  Where the light comes through the negative, the coating on the plate is  \\n  hardened.  When the plate is washed, the coated areas exposed to the  \\n  light remain on the plate, while the coating in the unexposed area \\n  washes away (the plate is said to have been \"developed\").  The image area  \\n  is now receptive to oil, while the plate area is receptive to water, and  \\n  as noted earlier, oil and water don\\'t mix. \\n \\n          The advantages of offset lithography are many.  Given a  \\n  reasonable length of press run (a hundred copies are the minimum for  \\n  offset, while jobs requiring three or four million copies can be produced  \\n  efficiently on offset as well), offset lithography gives excellent \\n  quality on a wide variety of papers in a large (more than 1500) number of  \\n  ink colors, for a very affordable price. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nENC 3-2 '}, vector=None),\n",

International Convention Of Standards Of Training, Certification And Watchkeeping For \\nSeafarers (STCW) 1978, as amended.   (2014)  \\nThe U.S. regulations (46 CFR Parts 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15) parallel  the provisions in \\nSTCW regarding the qualification and training requirements for watchstanding personnel.  \\nThrough various amendments, STCW prescribes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers, which Parties are obliged to meet or exceed.  \\nAlthough STCW does not include specific manning level requirements, it does impact  \\nmanning decisions where certification and training are concerned.  Except as noted in 46 CFR 15.1101(a)(1) and (2), the STCW regulations apply t o seagoing vessels as defined in \\n46 CFR 10.107.  As discussed in 46 CFR 15.1103, onboard a seagoing vessel operating beyond the boundary line, as described in 46 CFR Part 7, no person may employ or engage any person to serve, and no person may serve, in a position requiring a person to hold an STCW endorsement, including master, chief mate, chief engineer officer, second \\nengineer officer, officer of the navigational or engineering watch, or GMDSS radio \\noperator, unless the person serving holds an appropriat e, valid STCW endorsement issued \\nin accordance with 46 CFR Part 11.  Mariners engaged to perform certain shipboard \\nduties, as required by statute or regulation, are obliged to comply with the training and \\ncertification requirements of STCW, as applicable ( see paragraph B.3 of this Chapter).  \\n \\nNOTE:   2010 STCW Amendments, Transitional Provisions.  \\nThe 2010 STCW Amendments came into force on 1 January 2012, including the new \\nrequirements for minimum rest hours and record of hours of work.  In many cases, there is \\na five -year transitional period, until 1 January 2017*, to allow for a phased in \\nimplementation of the provisions.  However, in some cases (e.g. security endorsements) \\nimplementation is sooner.  Attention must be paid to these entry into force dates to ensure \\nappropriate compliance.  Nevertheless, after 1 January 2017*, all mariners serving on \\nvessels subject to STCW must meet the STCW Convention standards, including the 2010 \\nAmendments.   The International Maritime Organization (IMO) issued Circulars \\nSTCW.7/Circ.16,  STCW.7/Circ.17, and STCW.7/Circ.21 which provide clarification of \\nthe transitional provisions and advice (for P ort S tate C ontrol Officers) on the transitional \\narrangements leading up to full implementation of the 2010 Amendments to the STCW \\nConvention and Code on 1 January, 2017*.

Classifying an oil spill a \\nSONS provides additional support to the Federa l On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) to manage \\nnational, political, and policy level issues that result from a catastrophic spill or release. This \\nadditional support consists of the designation of a National Incident Commander (NIC).  \\nFigure 3-4 illustrates the typi cal NIC organizational structure.

AUTHORITY AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR MARINE SAFETY \\n              ACTIVITIES \\n \\n  A.  Sources Of Authority .  The basic authorities for all Coast Guard \\n      activities are found in the Public Laws (P.L.), Statutes at \\n      Large, Revised Statutes (R.S.) of the United States, United \\n      States Code (U.S.C.), Executive Orders (E 0.'s), various \\n      executive agency reorganization plans, and treaties and \\n      conventions to which the United States is party.  These are the \\n      sources which establish the Coast Guard's responsibilities and \\n      jurisdiction in marine safety matters.  If the Coast Guard has \\n      been assigned regulatory responsibility as part of its delegated \\n      authority in a particular field, the Commandant may then issue \\n      specific regulations designed to implement this authority.  When \\n      validly issued, these regulations carry the same force of law as \\n      the statute.  The following discussion outlines the main sources \\n      of law for marine safety programs, while highlighting the \\n      relative weight and significance of these authorities in our \\n      system of jurisprudence and law enforcement. \\n \\n     1.  Session Laws .  The primary source of authority for all Coast \\n         Guard activities lies in the Acts of Congress.  Acts of \\n         Congress are bills that are passed by both Houses of Congress \\n         and signed by the President, or again passed by both Houses \\n         after a Presidential veto.  These acts are first published in \\n         a form called session laws.  A session law can be identified \\n         by its public law number and the date of enactment.  The \\n         public law number is issued to each law in order of \\n         enactment.  For example, P.L. 83-500, July 15, 1954, \\n         represents the 500th law either signed by the President or \\n         enacted by the 83rd Congress over a presidential veto.  This \\n         form of identification is necessary only until publication of \\n         the statutes in a permanent form, generally until the end of \\n         the year in which enactment took place.  However, the use of \\n         the public law number continues to be permissible and is \\n         often useful in tracking legislative history. \\n \\n     2.  Statutes At Large .  All Acts of Congress are initially \\n         published in a permanent form in a series of volumes entitled \\n         Statutes at Large.  Originally issued as a cumulation of \\n         several years of Congressional actions, then as actions of a \\n         particular Congress for a 2-year period, Statutes at Large \\n         are now published annually and numbered sequentially.  As \\n         they were initially cumulations, volumes 1 through 5 cover \\n         the years 1789-1845.  Now there is a volume for each year; \\n         volume 83 contains the acts of the first session of the 91st \\n         Congress (1969).  Thus, volume 96 covers 1982, volume 97 \\n         covers 1983, etc. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 2-1                                 CH-7 \"}, vector=None),\n",

(cont\\'d)  attesting to the steamboat\\'s seaworthiness.  The \\n              law also required steamboats to carry certain firefighting \\n              and lifesaving equipment.  No provision was made for \\n              licensing of operating personnel, but owners were required \\n              to employ \"competent\" pilots and engineers.  These early \\n              inspections by the steamboat inspectors were mostly \\n              ineffective, and in 1852 Congress acted to improve the \\n              administration of the program.  The country was divided into \\n              nine districts, each under the jurisdiction of a \\n              \"supervising inspector.\"  Supervising inspectors directed the \\n              efforts of local inspectors and provided technical advice. \\n              These supervisory inspectors met annually to discuss \\n              problems of national importance and to strive for uniformity \\n              in administration of the program.  The new law also provided \\n              for the licensing of pilots and engineers. \\n \\n          b.  Steamboat Inspection Service .  After a series of marine \\n              disasters following the Civil War, Congress repealed all \\n              previous marine statutes and enacted a new comprehensive \\n              code of navigation and vessel inspection laws that became \\n              Title 52 of the Revised Statutes of the U.S.  The new laws \\n              provided for a \"Steamboat Inspection Service\" to include \\n              local inspectors of hulls and boilers and the licensing of \\n              masters and mates, and a local and national administrative \\n              organization under the Treasury Department in Washington, \\n              D.C.  The years that followed saw a gradual reduction in \\n              marine casualties. \\n \\n          c.  Twentieth-Century Developments .  The Steamboat Inspection \\n              Service was transferred to the Department of Commerce and \\n              Labor in 1903 and renamed the Bureau of Navigation and \\n              Steamboat Inspection.  Following the burning of the U.S. \\n              steamer MORRO CASTLE in 1934, the Bureau was reorganized. \\n              In 1936 it was renamed the Bureau of Marine Inspection and \\n              Navigation (BMIN), and in 1942 its duties were transferred \\n              to the Coast Guard.  A new component of this agency was a \\n              \"technical staff\" employed to review and approve plans for \\n              new passenger vessels which were to be of fireproof \\n              construction.  In addition, new statutory provisions in 1936 \\n              required all seamen on merchant ships of 100 gross tons (GT) \\n              or more to posses a Certificate of Identification or a \\n              Continuous Discharge Book (CDB) issued by the inspectors. \\n \\n          d.  Extensions Of Federal Laws .  The original inspection laws \\n              provided for the regulation of steamboats only for the \\n              purpose of passenger safety and, later, for crew safety. \\n              Gradually, Congress extended the provisions of the \\n              inspection laws to protect property and other groups of \\n              vessels as follows: \\n \\n              (1)  Sail vessels over 700 GT and barges over 100 GT carrying \\n                   passengers for hire, in 1898; \\n \\n              (2)  All mechanically-propelled vessels over 15 GT carrying \\n                   freight or passengers for hire, in 1905 (inspection) \\n                   and 1906 (licensing personnel); \\n \\n              (3)  Seagoing barges of 100 or more GT, in 1908; \\n \\n \\n                                 1-6 '}, vector=None),\n",

Early deployment of one to several SLDMBs \\nshould be given very serious consideration whenever there is significant potential for an \\nextended search.  \\n(a)Determining the availability and capabilities of search and rescue units (SRUs)  and other\\npotential search facilities .  In general, it is both more effective and more efficient to\\ndeploy/employ sufficient search facilities  to make an early successful concl usion highly\\nprobable, rather than use a more limited response  in the hope tha t no more resources will\\nbe necessary  or that gradua l escalation will minimize the commitment of resources .\\n(b)While it would be both impractical and imprudent to commit every  available resource\\nto every SAR incident, committing more than the bare minimum required for a “best\\ncase” scenario generally saves both more lives and more resources in the long run than\\na more gradual approach.\\n(c)Every SAR case is different so RCC w atchstanders must exercise sound judgment\\nwhen  deciding upon the scale of the response.   Watchstanders should bear in mind that\\nsituations requiring SAR responses can only get larger and more complex with the\\npassage of tim e until the survivors are found a nd rescued.\\n3.3.2.3  Including additional search criteria within the search plan based on local knowledge.  \\n3.3.3 Initial Conditions  \\nThe initial data, estimates and assumptions on which a search plan is based , often determine \\nwhether a search will be successful.  Therefore it is necessary to establish the time and \\nposition of the distress incident as accurately as possible.  Sometimes this is quite easy, as \\nwhen a craft accurately reports its position at the ti me of the distress.  At other times, such \\nas when a craft is unreported or overdue, a substantial investigative effort must be \\ninitiated and maintained throughout the case until the survivors are found or active \\nsearch is suspended pending further developm ents.   In addition, the pre -distress \\nmovements of the craft must be considered in order to properly match possible distress \\npositions with possible distress times.

Sleep and Rest  Human factor studies have identified fatigue as a significant factor \\nimpacting flight crew judgment and operational performance. Fatigue is alleviated and mental alertness is restored by proper sleep. Irregular and insufficient sleep patterns can create both immediate and long term  (or \\nchronic) fatigue. Noise, poor climate control, bright light, excitement, worry, daytime sleep period, or any other condition that is not conducive to restfulness will diminish the benefits of sleep. While the optimum amount of sleep varies among indiv iduals, the normal standard for flying \\npersonnel is eight continuous hours in every 24 -hour period. Factors such \\nas excessive fatigue, illness, and emotional stress tend to increase this standard. Mishap experience and studies indicate that any decrease in  a \\nflight crewmember’s ability to sleep will impact normal performance \\nfunctions and increases the likelihood of error. Since influence of \\nincreased error becomes particularly significant during operations at \\nnight and in poor weather, flights, watch stand ing requirements, and \\ncollateral duties should be assigned with due regard to providing \\nadequate crew rest for such assignments.  \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

Taxes \\nIntroduction This section presents information on taxes purely for guidance and is not \\nauthority for any tax actions.  The IRS has determined the Auxiliary and all \\nof its units (not including any corporati ons) are an integral part of the Federal \\nGovernment.  Auxiliary units are not requi red to file State or Federal income \\ntax returns.  \\nG.1.  Tax \\nLiability for \\nAuxiliary Units In addition to the exemption from fili ng Federal and State income tax returns \\nand paying Federal and State income taxes, Auxiliary units may also be \\nexempt from payment of State sales a nd use taxes on items the Auxiliary unit \\npurchases.  The granting of State sales and use tax exemptions varies from \\nState-to-State, and generally requires  t h e  i s s u a n c e  o f  a  S t a t e  S a l e s  T a x  \\nExemption number.  The exemption, if  granted, may only be used for the \\npurchase of Auxiliary unit property, whic h is paid for with unit funds, and is \\nnot available for individual purchases by Auxiliarists.  In some cases, the \\nexemption is only available if the pur chase is made with a Government \\npurchase order and paid for by Governme nt check or credit card.  Generally, \\nthe sales tax exemption for each state ha s been applied for by the Auxiliary \\nNational Legal Directorate or appropri ate DSO-LP, who maintains records of \\nthe sales tax exemption status for each state.  In addition, the appropriate \\nDSO-LP will be able to provide information and guidance to Auxiliary unit \\nleaders.  \\nG.2.  Sale of \\nItems to Others Auxiliary units that sell items to others  may be required to collect, report, and \\nremit State sales tax on such sales.  Re quirements vary from State-to-State.  \\nSpecific guidance must be sought from the DSO-LP.  \\nG.3.

Lookout \\nEquipmentStanding a proper lookout watch means using all available equipment to \\nimprove chance of early detection.  These items include binoculars, \\nsunglasses, and night vision devices (if equipped).\\nBinoculars are the lookout’s best tool to increase their distance vision \\ncapabilities.  They are very good for identifying contacts far off and obtaining \\ndetailed information when they get closer.  While they do increase the distance \\nthe eye can see, they also reduce a person’s field of vision or how much the \\neye can see.  It is important to remember to switch between using binoculars \\nand just eyes to make sure nothing goes unnoticed.\\nOn a sunny day, a large portion of the horizon might be difficult to observe \\ndue to the sun’s reflection on the surface of the water.  A g ood pair of \\nsunglasses will reduce eyestrain and glare allowing vision where normally it \\nwould be difficult.\\nThe use of night vision equipment increases the chance of detecting objects \\nin the dark.  This equipment easily detects even the faintest source oflight.   \\nThey can also be very useful when looking for an unlit object if there is \\nsufficient background lighting.  Care should be taken when using this \\nequipment, since pointing it at a bright light might diminish night vision and \\ndamage the equipment. Most night vision equipment provides a single color \\n(usually green) image.  The single color will reduce depth perception and \\nmake distance estimation more difficult.\\nThermal imaging devices, where available, can be used in cases where there \\nis no light at all.  They can be of particular use when searching for persons in \\nthe water (PIW) when arriving on scene prior to commencing a search \\npattern as well as during an active search.  Night vision maybe compromised \\nif the monitor’s display brilliance is set too high.    \\nD.6. Object \\nIdentificationLookouts must report what they see, smell, or hear with as much detail as \\npossible.  Object type is immediately important (vessel, buoy, breaking \\nwaves), but additional details may help the coxswain in decision-making.  The \\nfollowing are some obvious characteristics of objects:\\n(01)Color,\\n(02)Shape,\\n(03)Size.\\nAt night, lookouts must identify the color of all lights.

SURGE FORCES FOR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT \\n“Coast Guard leaders must be ready to surge re sources to augment the response organization’s \\nsize, scope, technical and l ogistical expertise to address the requirements of complex and \\nexpanding incidents. ”—Incident Management and Cr isis Response, COMDTPUB 3-28  \\nA. Overview . The challenge faced by all Coast Guard l eaders is summed up very succinctly in \\nthe above excerpt from Reference (k).  Comm anding officers are responsible for conducting \\ncurrent operations while ensuring their unit’s preparedness to re spond to incidents/events of \\nvarying types.  The effective employment of surg e forces is a key element in being able to \\nhandle incidents that may require personnel or ex pertise that are not readily available at each \\nunit.  \\nB. Concept of Employment . The Coast Guard’s approach to ensuring effective surge operations \\nrelies on the use of Deployable Specialized Forces (DSFs), Deployable Support Elements \\n(DSEs), Emergency Response Teams (ERTs), m obile assets and active, reserve, and \\nauxiliary personnel qualified to perform additi onal duties during surge operations.  The Coast \\nGuard’s bench strength enables it to surge reso urces to meet the demands of incidents of \\nvarying size, scope, and technical complexity.  \\nC. RFF Process . \\n1. Request for Forces (RFF) .  \\na. RFF Support .  Reference (m) is the primary COMDTINST that addresses the process \\nfor obtaining personnel resources to meet su rge requirements.  Areas and DCMS have \\nadditional requirements for their assets: \\n(1) Area Resources .  RFFs for Area assets shall be  requested thro ugh the respective \\nchain of command using the command cente r network to the appropriate Area \\nCommand Center or, if activ ated, the Area IMT.  For emergent requests, units \\nshall contact the appropriate Area via mo st expeditious means for the requested \\ncapability.  The Area, in turn, shall build  a Critical Information Communications \\n(CIC)-like teleconference with all involved commands, ensuring that all \\ninvolved parties within the chain-of-c ommand are on the call and are able to \\nparticipate in the decision process.   \\n(2) DCMS Resources .  RFFs for DCMS DSE and ot her mission support, technical \\nspecialists from Service Centers and Logi stics Centers shall be requested from \\nthe DCMS Watch at DOL-4.  The DCMS Watch, in turn, shall build a CIC-like \\nteleconference with all involved commands. \\n(3) Other Agency Assets .  Requests for Assistance (RFA) for other agency \\nresources, i.e., NOAA Scientific Advisor, shall be requested per the RFF process \\ndescribed for area resources. \\nb. Force Deploymenet Planning & Execution (FDP&E) Support .  Reference (aa) is the \\nprimary COMDTINST that addresses the FDP&E process including procedures for \\nobtaining strategic lift in support of  CCDR or Service requirements. \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

In January 2013, ALAUX 001/13 announced launch of the Auxiliary Learning Management System \\n(AUXLMS) and its impact on Auxiliary Mandated Training (MT) requirements for new enrollees.  \\nNew enrollees were required to complete all Auxiliary MT courses withi n their first year of \\nenrollment.  The first year of enrollment was defined as the Base Enrollment Date (BED) until 31 \\nDecember of the year following the BED.  For example, if a new enrollee had a BED of 15 November \\n2013, then they had until 31 December 2014  to complete all mandated training.  \\n \\n2. At the Auxiliary National Convention in August 2014, Auxiliary national leadership and the Chief \\nDirector of Auxiliary determined it appropriate to extend the deadline for Auxiliary MT completion \\nfor Auxiliarists who  have enrolled since January 2013.  Accordingly, the deadline has been extended \\nfrom 31 December 2014 to 31 December 2015.  \\n \\n3. The deadline for Auxiliary MT completion for Auxiliarists who were already enrolled by January \\n2013 remains 31 December 2016.  \\n \\n4. Auxiliary MT is comprised of the following courses:  \\n \\na. To be successfully completed during the first year of enrollment and then once every five \\nyears thereafter:  \\n(1) Building Resilience and Preventing Suicide in the Coast Guard - course code \\n502379  \\n(2) Security Fundamentals - course code 810030  \\n(3) Privacy at DHS: Protecting Personal Information - course code 810015  \\n(4) Sexual Harassment Prevention - course code 810000  \\n(5) Sexual Assault Prevention / Response - course code 810045  \\n(6) Civil Rights Awarene ss - course code 502319  \\n \\nb.

Recent changes to Coast Guard policy on Incident Command System (ICS) training \\nrequirements have resulted in the following additions to Auxiliary MT, to be successfully \\ncompleted only once:  \\n(1) Introduction to the Incident Command System - ICS-100 \\n(2) Introduction to Natio nal Incident Management System (NIMS) - IS-700 \\n \\nNew enrollees must complete these ICS courses during the first year of enrollment.  \\nAuxiliarists who have enrolled since January 2013 must complete them by 31 \\nDecember 2015.

Eventually, there may be an expansion of services for \\nthis class of vessel which would necessitate inspection, such as its use as an industrial \\nvessel. Coast Guard regulations do not currently address specific credentialing  and \\nmanning requirements for submersibles.  A manning and licensing proposal should be submitted to Commandant (CG -CVC) via the Officer -in-Charge, Marine Inspection \\n(OCMI).  This proposal should address the levels of personnel training and qualifications including certifications held, as well as the number of personnel considered necessary for the safe operation of the vessel.  The credentialed  officers  as well as any crewmembers  \\nwould be required to complete a comprehensive course prescribed by the vessel  \\nmanufacturer.

The user must then enter the Search Speed in knots.   After this value is \\nentered,  the user must select the (primary) Sensor that will be used from the drop down \\nlist of choices obtained by selecting the down arrow next to the Sensor field.   Unless it is \\ngrayed out, the user then selects the “Details” button and fills in the appropriate  information \\nsuch as search altitude for Visual search.  For Visual search, the “Select” button brings up \\na table showing sweep widths for various altitudes.  The user may select an altitude from \\nthis list and then “OK” or “Cancel” and enter it directly fr om the keyboard in the “Search \\nAltitude” field.  Once the “Details” have been completed, the sweep width(s) for the search \\nobject(s) will be computed and displayed in the “Search Objects” section of the “SRU \\nProperties” window.  \\n(h) Each search object type in the simulation and its sweep width is displayed in the “Search \\nObjects” section.  There is also a check box next to each of the named search object types.  \\nIf the box is checked, then objects of that type will be considered for planning purposes as \\nPlanner attempts to maximize the POS.  If the box is not checked, then the SRU identified \\nin the first field of the “SRU Properties” window is made, for planning purposes, \\ncompletely “blind” to that search object type and objects of that type will not be consi dered \\nby Planner as it attempts to maximize POS  with that SRU .  This is useful in situations \\nwhere the search planner wants to concentrate the search effort (maximize the POS) for the \\nmost vulnerable search object type (such as a PIW) and then accept whate ver POS results \\nare produced for the other search object type(s).  If all SRUs had only “PIW” checked, for \\nexample, then the result would be a near -optimal search plan for PIWs.  Another way this \\nfeature can be used is to have Planner try to have one SRU c oncentrate on a particular \\nsearch object type (e.g., have the helicopter concentrate  on PIWs) while another SRU  \\nconcentrates on a different search object type (e.g., have the fixed wing aircraft concentrate \\non life rafts).  This is most useful if the two search object types have separated somewhat \\ndue to differing drift rates and/or directions.  It is less useful i n the early hours following \\nthe distress while all search object types are still well -mixed in the same general area.  \\n(i) Caution:   When multiple search object types are involved, SAROPS Planner will initially \\nbe “attracted” to those having the largest swe ep width , all other things being equal .  This \\nis most apparent when differences in sweep width are large, such as a 6 -person life raft \\ncompared to a PIW.  Since Planner’s objective is to maximize overall POS, an “optimal” \\nsearch where both object types are  equally weighted could be very close to the same as an \\noptimal search for just  the object having the largest sweep width .  It could be substantially \\nsub-optimal for small search objects such as PIWs.   If an optimal PIW search is desired, \\nthen all SRUs sho uld have only the PIW box(es) checked.  When the completed search is \\nevaluated in Simulator as part of planning a subsequent search, all object types will be \\nincluded  regardless of whether some types were ignored for planning purposes during the \\nplanning p hase.  No information of data is “lost” by un -checking search object types on the \\n“SRU Properties” page  for the purposes of planning a search . \\n(j) Once the use r is satisfied with all of the entries for “SRU Properties,” the “OK” button is \\nselected to retur n to the “SRUs” page.  At this point, the user may either add another SRU \\nor proceed to the next step.  At the bottom of the “SRUs” page are two check boxes where \\nthe user may select whether Planner is to include only adrift particles, only landed particle s, \\nor both adrift and landed particles  as it tries to maximize POS.

Voyage Monitoring . Voyage monitoring is the process of continuously monitoring a vessel’s planned \\nvoyage to ensure the plan is follo wed. Voyage monitoring includes establishing procedures for \\nmaking changes to the established voyage plan and making appropriate notifications when changes \\nare required.   \\nM. The Basics of Electronic Navigation Systems . Coast Guard installed electronic naviga tion systems vary \\nin complexity and in their ability to mitigate navigational risk. System capabilities range from display of \\na vessel’s position on an approved electronic chart to systems that integrate all navigation sensors. On \\nmore modern platforms, el ectronic navigation systems also interface with external tactical systems. \\nAlarms from sensors and from chart data can warn of potentially dangerous situations well in advance. \\nElectronic navigation systems do not replace the process of navigation, but the ir ability to integrate real -\\ntime position information with an electronic chart display allows vessels to have an immediate \\nassessment of position. However, over reliance on electronic navigation systems can cause tunnel vision \\nor ignorance of fundamental signs of danger. To prevent this, it is critical to understand system \\nlimitations and use foundational navigation skills to properly prepare these systems and detect errors.  \\n1. Approved Coast Guard Electronic Navigation Systems (eNav) . Commandant (CG -751) maintains a \\nlist of approved Coast Guard electronic nav igation systems and additional information to support \\nunit electronic navigation capabilities at the Cutter Forces website \\nhttps://cg.portal.uscg.mil/units/cg751/NAV/Forms/AllItems.aspx .  \\n2. System Configuration and Settings . When using electronic navigation systems for navigation, it is \\ncritical to ensure cutter and boat personnel responsible for navigation have a thorough unde rstanding \\nof the system’s operation and functional capabilities as it is easy for operators to manipulate the \\nsystem settings, configurations, or display to function against safe navigation practices, thereby \\nincreasing risk to the cutter or boat. Ensuring  correct system inputs, such as cutter or boat draft \\ninformation and masthead height, are critical to effective system operation.   \\n \\n3. Electronic Navigation Display Objects . Depending on the chart type in use, electronic navigation \\nsystems allow operators to  display certain chart information in layers. Typically, this chart \\ninformation falls into one of three categories.  \\n  \\na. Display Base . The chart content that cannot be removed from the display. This represents the \\nminimum set of information and is not intende d to be sufficient for navigation.  Shallow water, \\nsafety contour, and isolated hazards to navigation are included in the display base depending on \\nthe cutter or boat information entered into the eNav system.   \\n \\nb. Standard Display . The minimum information re quired for display during route planning and \\nroute monitoring for safe navigation of the vessel.   \\n   \\nc. All Other Information . Other information, in addition to the standard display, to be shown \\nindividually (by class) on demand, to ensure safe navigation of  specific operating areas/ \\nconditions.  \\n \\n4. Use of System Profiles . Many electronic navigation systems have the capability to set, save, and lock \\noperator settings in a profile. This allows transition from one Navigation Zone/Area to another \\nquickly and reliably, with the same set of settings applied consistently. For instance, the dead \\nreckoning interval and chart features displayed onscreen vary depending on the navigational  '}, vector=None),\n",

Nevertheless, Coverage, POD, and  POC are still useful \\nconcepts for discussing POS and area versus coverage tradeoffs in general terms . \\n3.6.2  The Value of Using POS  \\nPOS calculates search effectiveness by incorporating POC with the POD.  POD only \\nmeasures detection effectiveness; that is, it is used to estimate how well a search area was \\nsearched, but it does not incorporate the likelihood that the object will actually be in the \\nparticular area searched , or, in SAROPS terms, the chances that the search facility will \\napproach the object clos ely enough to make detection possible .  POS does.   \\n3.6.2.1  The following examples will clarify this discussion:  \\n(a) Searching an area that has no chance of containing the search object (POC = 0) will not \\nbe successful no matter how high the POD.  Even if POD was 100% (which is not \\nrealistic) the POS is still zero (0 x 1 = 0).  \\n(b) To give a more realistic example, if there is a 50% chance of the search object being in \\nan area, then searching that area with a coverage factor of 1.0 (POD of 78%) produces \\na PO S of 39% (.5 x .78 = .39).  Even if POD was 100% (again unrealistic), the POS for \\nthis search rises to only 50% (.5 x 1 = .5) and no further because there is still a 50% \\nchance that the search object was not in the search area.  \\n3.6.2. 2 POS balances options  of looking very carefully in a small area for the object (s) against \\nlooking less thoroughly over a larger area for the same object (s).  As an analogy, think of \\nlooking for a misplaced set of keys.  One could meticulously look for the keys in the sofa; \\nmoving pillows, pulling apart cushions, putting one’s hands under the sofa and in the joints \\nof the furniture (high POD but low POC).  Or, the same time could be used searching for \\nthe keys by scanning the tops of the sofa, mantel, bookcase and the rest of th e family room \\nand kitchen, concentrating on the most likely spots (lower POD but high POC).  If it were \\nknown that the keys were lost in the sofa, option one would yield a higher POS.  If there \\nwas uncertainty about where the keys were last seen or lost, t hen option two would probably \\nyield a higher POS.  \\n3.6.3  Determining POS  \\n3.6.3.1  Manual Solution.   The manual solution always incorporate d POC and POS.  However, for \\nmany years it did so in a way that was hidden from the search planner.  Search planners, \\nprior to the advent of CASP , the IAMSAR Manual , and now SAROPS , did not use POC and \\nPOS because there was no practical way to compute them manually.  Unfortunately, this \\nleft an incorrect impression that POD was the sole statistic of interest in terms of m easuring \\nsearch effectiveness.  It is not.  As previously stated, POS is the measure of overall search \\nquality/effectiveness.   \\n '}, vector=None),\n",

Invitations \\nIntroduction This section describes the proper protocol for handling invitations. \\nE.1.  Types of \\nInvitations There are several basic forms for invita tions.  The individual extending the \\ninvitation should select the format most suited to the specific function and to \\nthe invitee.  Formal invita tions, either printed or in letter format, should be \\nused for official visitors  invited to attend formal dinners, dinner dances, or \\nceremonial occasions.  A less formal invitation may be used for other events \\nsuch as regular meetings, raft-outs, or rendezvous.  \\nE.2.  \\nInformation \\nIncluded Courtesy to the invitee includes the provi sion of all information regarding the \\nevent for which the invitation is extende d.  This includes specific information \\nregarding the place, date, time, uniform  required, whether or not the invitee \\nis expected to bring a guest, and what pa rt (if any) the invitee is expected to \\nplay in the program.  \\nE.3.  RSVP One way to ascertain whether or not the invitee will attend is to request an \\nRSVP.  If it is important for planning purposes to determine if guests will be \\npresent, indicate RSVP (phone number or  a d d r e s s )  n o t  l a t e r  t h a n  ( d a t e  t h e  \\nreply is needed).  If an invitation with an RSVP requirement is received, \\ncourtesy requires an a ppropriate response to th e person who sent the \\ninvitation.  Failure to do so may pu t the potential host in an embarrassing \\nposition.  \\nE.4.  Expenses Regardless of the civilian, Auxiliary, or Coast Guard st atus of the invitee, if \\nan invitation stipulates, “It is our plea sure to extend an invitation to you and \\nMrs. Doe to attend our Cha nge of Watch Dinner as our guest,” Mr. Doe will \\nassume that he will not be expected to pay for dinner tickets for himself and \\nhis guest.  In order to extend an invitati on to an event in which the invitee is \\nexpected to pay, state, “It is our pleasu re to ask you and Mrs. Doe to join us \\nat our Change of Watch.”  Then include the cost of the event, and enclose a \\nreservation form in the letter.  \\nE.5.  Timeliness The more senior the guest, the earlier they must establish a schedule.  If the \\ninvitation is to a senior Coast Gu ard officer or a National Auxiliary \\nrepresentative of the Auxiliary, it has the best chance of being accepted if it \\nis received at least eight weeks in advance of the event.  \\n12-13  '}, vector=None),\n",

The Rescue 21 communications system provides \\ndirection finding as an integrated function.  This is a significant tool that will as sist in \\nlocating vessels in distress.  Because every call on channel 16 will generate a line of \\nbearing on the Geo Display it is important to remember that weaker signals will be stepped \\non or blocked out by the stronger signals.  If a mayday is detected a nd the Operational \\nUnit  (OU) watchstander and/or Communications Unit (CU) watchstander are unable \\nto isolate the call because of heavy non -emergent traffic then the CU watchstander shall \\nsend out a “SEELONCE MAYDAY” broadcast ( Reference (s) , chapter 2.F o r Section \\n4.1.6.8) to limit the traffic and subsequently the LOB’s that appear on the Geo Display \\nscreen.  This action should assist the OU and CU watchstanders in isolating the mayday \\nsignal.  \\n2.5.6.2  VHF -FM Idiosyncrasies.   The Rescue 21 communications sy stem is not immune to those \\nidiosyncrasies that plague the VHF -FM system.  These issues include Tropospheric \\nducting (skip), echoing, block -out, transmission reception quality, and transmission \\nbounce.   \\n(a) Tropospheric Ducting  is where a radio transmission is received at the command \\ncenter that is beyond the communications system operating limits.  This can also be \\nrelated to skip or tunneling.  The speed of a radio wave in the atmosphere is determined \\nby the dielectric propert y of the air. This property depends on the pressure, \\ntemperature and humidity of the air. In general as we move upwards through the \\natmosphere the pressure decreases and temperature falls. This means that the dielectric \\nproperty changes with height and all ows a slight increase in the speed of a radio wave \\nas we move upwards through the atmosphere. This in turn means that if a radio wave \\nmoves away from the earth at an angle less than 90 degrees, then the upper part of the \\nwave travels faster than the lower part. Therefore even under normal conditions this \\ncan in effect bend, or refract, the wave back down to earth.  \\n The normal rate of change of dielectric constant with height refracts the wave so that \\nit follows a curved path of about 1.3 times the radius of  the earth. Therefore, we \\ntypically can receive signals which are 1.3 times further than we can see by line of \\nsight.  \\n Tropospheric ducting occurs when we get a sharp rate of change in the dielectric \\nconstant as we move upwards through the atmosphere. This  occurs when we get a \\nrapid increase of temperature and a rapid decrease in humidity (dew -point) with \\nheight.  \\n Under these conditions we now have the radio wave bent back towards the earth.  \\nHowever, the radio wave can then reflect back off the earth and b ecome refracted '}, vector=None),\n",

Paddle Craft Operators Awarded 1 Point for E ach Patrol H our Toward Earning RBS \\nInsignia  (Originator: D NACO  LANT -West and DNACO PAC)  \\na.  Discussion :  It is recommended that members earning the certification as Paddle Craft \\nOperator be awarded 1 point for each patrol toward earning the RBS Insignia. \\n \\n(1) The Paddlecraft Operators Certi fication was established with the promulgation of \\nCOMDTINST 16794.11A on August 18, 2018. Since that time members of the \\nUSCGAUX have purchased and equipped Paddlecraft and completed the Paddlecraft Operator PQS to earn the certification as a Paddlecraft Operator.  \\n (2) Unlike Coxswains or Personal Watercraft Operators in the Surface Program and Pilots in \\nthe Aviation Program, Paddlecraft Operators are not awarded any insignia to designate them as a Paddlecraft Operator. Currently participants in the Recreat ional Boating Safety \\nprogram can earn the privilege of wearing the Recreational Boating Safety Insignia by earning points for performing RBS activities as outlined in Chapter 10 sections F.9.o and F.9.o (1) and (2) of the AUXMAN. A total of 240 points,120 points per year for two consecutive years, must be earned.  \\n (3) It is recommended that a member attaining certification as a Paddlecraft Operator be \\nawarded 1 point per patrol hour toward the 120 points per year earned over a two- year \\nperiod needed to earn the RBS insignia. Should the Operator go into REYR/REWK status for any reason as a Paddlecraft Operator the Operator forfeits the points earned for patrols and will need to accumulate the needed 240 points by participating in the activities outlined in the sections of the AUXMAN cited above and/or start the patrol points accumulations anew. \\nb.  National Board A ction :  Approved. \\nc.  Chief Director F inal A ction:  Approved, with clarification that points will not be forfeited \\nshould the Operator go into REYR/REWK status  for any reason as a Paddlecraft Operator . \\nAdditionally, appropriate modifications must first be made to AUXDATA II to properly implement this change. Such modifications should be completed by NACON 2023 and will be announced as \\npart of the synoptic change summaries issued by the AUXDATA II Change Advisory Board (CAB ).  \\n    \\nRespectfully,  \\nCaptain Troy P.

The information available to the pilot  \\nincludes ground speed, cross -track error, and relative positioning to \\nvarious waypoints. Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space -based \\nradio -navigation system consisting of a network of satellites and ground \\nstations. It provides location, altitude, and time information in all weather conditions.  \\nWide Area Augmentation Systems (WAAS) is a navigation aid \\ndeveloped by the FAA to augment the GPS system.

Also, the QE should send a report of the failure to the AQEC.  \\nOn rare occasions a candidate may fail their check ride due to the lack of ability on the part of the certified coxswain or crew.  When this happens, the QE should re -\\nschedule the candidate with a different facility, \\ncoxswain, and/or crew.  The QE (or QEIC) should then contact the \\nAQEC and have the problem addr essed.  The candidates FC should also \\nbe made aware of the problem.  The AQEC , through the CQEC and the \\nOTO, may schedule the deficient member for a check ride.

When deciding whether a specific person is appropriate to act as SMC, \\nconsider the following  about both the individual and command capabilities : \\n(a) The nature and complexity of the case.  Factors that contribute to complexity include:  \\n(1) Number of participating SAR facilities and their parent organization s (e.g. DOD, \\nother nation, etc.) ; \\n(2) Number and complexity of probable scenarios ; \\n(3) Number s and type s of search objects ; \\n(4) Number of possible persons to be assisted/saved ; \\n(5) Level of m edia interest ; \\n(6) Other coincidental missions involved (i.e. pollution, mass rescue, law enforcement, \\netc.); and  \\n(7) Pre-existin g plans, MOUs, and relationships . \\n(b) Other f actors to consider include:  \\n(1) The adequacy of the unit's command, control , and communications capability in \\nterms of equipment, personnel, training and experience,  \\n(2) The unit's geographic proximity to the incident.  Per reference (a), if a SAR mission \\ncrosses areas of responsibility (AORs) or SRRs, the RCC within whose region  the \\nlast position report was received assumes overall responsibility.  If the last report \\nreceived was at the boundary of two regions, or if no position report was received, \\nthe RCC of the region the craft was entering usually assumes responsibility.  \\n(c) Amver accessibility shall reside at the District/Area level and will not be delegated to \\nthe Sector  level.  This does not preclude a Sector from requesting their District Command \\nCenter run an Amver SURPIC for a case  where the Sector is SMC .  However, Amver  is \\nmost useful for offshore cases, usually outside Sector AORs .  Typically, SMC for these \\ntypes of cases resides at the District/Area level.  \\n1.2.2. 5 Initiating Responsibility.   Responsibility for initiating a response to distress incidents and \\nrequests for assistance rests with the coordinator of the region or sector in whose area the \\nincident occurs.  When boundary or location ambiguities exist, the unit receiving initial \\nnotification shall assume SMC and take immediate action to provide a response.  SMC of \\na distress incident shall be retained until the incident is terminated or until proper relief is \\neffected.  \\n1.2.2. 6 Coast Guard SMC Assumption.   The Coast Guard should normal ly assume SMC according \\nto Table 1 -2, which is based on AORs.  These SMC designations are the lowest levels \\nnormally assigned.  SAR Coordinators may use discretion in SMC assignments where non -\\ncomplex cases straddle sector  (or district) boundaries and the mission may be effectively \\ncoordinated by one of the involved sector s (or involved districts).   \\n(a) Incidents that require the SMC to be at the District RCC level or above are:  \\n(1) Initial action for cases involving ELT and EPIRB, HF -DSC, and Inmarsat ale rts; to \\nensure that cases are managed effectively throughout the Coast Guard.

Tonnage.    \\nThe majority of military vessels are not measured in gross or net ton nage.  Therefore, it is \\nnecessary for the evaluating officer to estimate the gross tonnage of the vessels for which \\nexperience is claimed.  The formula \"DISPLACEMENT x .57\" provides an acceptable estimate of gross tonnage (use full load displacement).  Jan e\\'s Fighting Ships is an \\nexcellent reference for finding the vital statistics of U.S. military vessels.  It is likely that this source will provide the displacement for most military vessels. All Coast Guard high endurance cutters (WHECs), medium endurance  cutters (WMECs) of the Bear class only \\n(270 foot cutter), icebreakers (WAGBs), and the USCGC Eagle are over 1600 gross tons. All other Coast Guard vessels currently in service are less than 1600 gross tons.  Former Coast Guard vessels of 255 feet (77 meters) and up were over 1600 gross tons.  \\n \\n4. Calculation of Service.    \\nMilitary sea service shall be evaluated sequentially in the order obtained over the course of a military career, which reflects the same progression for a merchant mariner. Tonnage and horsepower limitations, if any, shall be calculated for each license level through the progression.  It is not acceptable to average tonnage or horsepower over a career.  Pay particular attention to the recency requirements in 46 CFR 10.202(e) because recency, or lack thereof, can also limit the tonnage or horsepower for an original license.  \\n \\n5. Description Of Duties Evaluation.    \\nThe most troublesome aspect of the military evaluation is translating military duties to meet the experience requirements specified in 46  CFR Part 10.  Based upon past \\nevaluations, the following guidelines have been developed.  See Figure 2 -2 and 2- 3 of this \\nchapter for further explanations and examples.  \\na. Officers.    \\nDeck watch officers\\' (DWOs) and engineering watch officers\\' (EWOs) duties are \\nconsidered equivalent to the watchstanding duties performed by licensed mates and engineers respectively aboard merchant vessels.  Therefore, this qualifying sea service may be used to satisfy the experience requirements for an original or raise of grade of a mate or assistant engineer license.  For an original third\\'s license, up to eighteen months service as DWO/EWO may be substituted for up to 36 months of unlicensed service.  One day of service as a DWO or EWO is counted as 2 days of unlicensed sea service to meet the requirements of the regulations.  When computing sea service toward a license grade above third, such as an original second, or a raise of grade, DWO/EWO time is creditable on a one -for-one basis. Service experience obtained as \\na junior  officer of the deck (JOOD) is considered equivalent (on a one -for-one basis) \\nto able seaman time.  See examples at the end of this chapter.  \\n '}, vector=None),\n",

(cont\\'d) vessel safety, occupational health, drug \\n              and alcohol enforcement, and maritime pollution areas. \\n \\n              (1)  Discussion .  Generally, CWO\\'s serving in vessel \\n                   inspection billets are qualified as either hull or \\n                   machinery inspectors, or both.  ENG\\'s are assumed to \\n                   be machinery inspectors; BOSN\\'s and WEP\\'s hull \\n                   inspectors.  MAT\\'s are also assumed to be hull \\n                   inspectors; however, MAT\\'s who have had extensive \\n                   sea time and served as underway EWO\\'s are likely \\n                   machinery inspector candidates.  It takes nearly two \\n                   years to become a qualified marine inspector.  There \\n                   are approximately 25 vessel inspection training \\n                   billets divided between four ports:  New York, New \\n                   Orleans, San Francisco, and Seattle.  Graduates of \\n                    the twoyear training program are reassigned to \\n                   fouryear vessel inspection duty billets.  Usually \\n                   there is an insufficient number of training port \\n                   graduates to fill all vessel inspection duty \\n                   billets.  Consequently, \"trainees\" must often be \\n                   assigned to duty inspection billets. \\n              (2)  Procedures .  CWO marine inspectors shall be assigned \\n                   based on qualification, not occupational specialty. \\n                   For example, a MAT who is a qualified machinery \\n                   inspector could be assigned to either ENG or MAT MMS \\n                   billets.  An ENG who is both a qualified machinery \\n                   and hull inspector (double-ender) could be assigned \\n                   to ENG, BOSN, MAT, or WEP\\'s MMS billets.  Removing \\n                   billet specialty constraints serves two \\n                   purposes:  It provides CWO\\'s with a greater \\n                   variety of billets from which to choose, resulting \\n                   in a more satisfied work force.  It also provides \\n                    the assignment officer greater flexibility by \\n                   increasing the candidate pool.  Ideally, CWO MMS \\n                   trainees should have a maximum of 15 years active \\n                   service at the time they are assigned to an MMS \\n                   billet.  However, CWO\\'s with experience desirable to \\n                   the MMS program (prior RIO duty, prior MSO \\n                   assignments), former MST, extensive underway \\n                   engineering experience), who the assignment officer \\n                   believes will complete a 26- to 30-year career, may \\n                   be assigned as trainees. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 6-9                                 CH-6 '}, vector=None),\n",

The \\nguidance in this chapter should be used to help develop inter  \\nand intra-agency contingency plans and incident \\nmanagement structures for a mass casualty/mass rescue  \\nincident.  \\nNote: The CG uses the term “mass rescue” while state, \\ntribal, and local organizations  may use the terms “mass \\ncasualty ”, “multi -casualty ”, or “mass care” as described in \\nreference (h). These terms are generally interchangeable for the purposes of this Handbook . \\nDue to the rapid and dynamic response needed to save lives the CG should focus first on incident command and coordination with state, tribal, and local fire and EMS \\norganizations . State, tribal, and local fire and EMS officials \\nare critical partners to suc cessfully saving the most lives \\npossible during a mass casualty/ mass rescue incident.  Only \\nafter command and coordination systems and structures are \\ndeveloped, and the dynamic nature of the initial response is lessened, will the IC/UC be able to begin IAP development. \\nThis may require the IC/UC to remain in the initial response \\n(stem of the Planning P) phase for an extended period of time.  \\nFor mass casualty/m ass rescue incidents near shore where \\nnotifications are typically received through the 911 system as  \\nwell as very high frequency ( VHF) radio, t he CG should be \\nprepared for state, tribal, and local organizations  to quickly \\nestablish an ICP.

This check ride workload issue, if not \\naddressed, will repeat itself in 2024.   \\n  \\n2. Effective immediately, a ll QE check rides that were last completed in 2018, 2019, and 2020 will have \\ntheir task expiration dates extended by one year in AUXDATA II (e.g. if a check ride was last completed in \\n2018 and is due by the end of 2021, then the expiration date is extended  by one year to 2022). QE check ride \\nexpiration dates will be updated in AUXDATA in the near future.   \\n  \\n3. This extension does not include QE check ride tasks that were waived/extended by reference (a), nor is it \\na blanket waiver to exempt surface operators from having to complete a check ride. It  allows districts \\nto manage their risk, proficiency and check -ride workload by prioritizing their most urgent check rides. If a \\ndistrict has the capacity to complete all QE check -rides which have task expir ation dates in CY 2021, then \\nthey can coordinate their QEs to do so. Once a check -ride is completed and the task is entered in \\nAUXDATA II, the new expiration date will automatically be set to the end of the third year from the date of \\nthe new QE check -ride per reference (b).   \\n  \\n4.

FLIR has a very narrow field of view.  Most units operate with a 7 -15 degree\\nfield of view.  Recommen ded sweep widths and altitudes for use of FLIR are contained\\nin Appendix H.  Sweep widths should not exceed the effective azimuthal coverage of\\nthe system in use.  Appendix H also contains illustrations of how to estimate a sweep\\nwidth for a FLIR unit.\\n3.4.6.5 Night Vision Goggles (NVG).   Many SAR incidents occur or become known to the Coast \\nGuard during the afternoon or night.  The greatest benefit of NVG is that this sensor enables \\nsearchers to conduct effective searches at night, thus search planners wil l not have to wait \\nuntil first light the following day to begin effective visual searches. This will increase the \\nprobability of survival for those persons in distress.  Research showed NVG  searches from \\nvessel s are not recommended because the lookouts are  prone to seasickness when using \\nNVG, but they are effective from aircraft.  Sweep Width Tables for NVG Searches are \\nprovided in Appendix H.  \\n3.4.6.6  Photo Reconnaissance Support.   Photoreconnaissance is one resource that may have \\nlimited benefit in locatin g those in distress in a large maritime search area.   Aircraft \\nequipped for highflying photography include Coast Guard fixed -wing aircraft equipped with \\nElectro -Optical Sensor Systems (ESS) , some U.S. Air Force aircraft, and some aircraft from \\nother agenci es.  Satellite imagery is also continuously improving and may be available for \\nthe area of interest associated with a particular SAR incident.  '}, vector=None),\n",

General Media Relations .  Coast Guard units are highly visible \\n           and generally make good news copy, However, it is the reporter's \\n           job to determine what is broadcast or printed.  PAO's can improve \\n           their chances of getting Coast Guard stories published by \\n           developing a cooperative relationship with media personnel-on a \\n           regular basis.  A positive relationship enhances the credibility \\n           of both the unit and the Coast Guard.  The PAO should pay \\n           particular attention to reporters who cover the maritime industry \\n           and government.  A good working relationship with this group \\n           enables the unit to-get information about the preventive aspects \\n           of our job to the people we serve.  PAO's must remember that news \\n           broadcasts and articles in newspapers and magazines are not the \\n           proper medium to express personal opinions.

Subsequent Applicability Of ABS Classification .  After \\n              initial approval of hull and machinery classifications, \\n              continued ABS classification and a vessel's Possession of \\n              a current classification certificate are generally \\n              accepted as evidence of structural efficiency and \\n              machinery reliability.  However, such classification must \\n              be considered in the light of all known facts, including \\n              conditions reported by crewmembers or found by the \\n              inspector.  Thus, the inspector must know: \\n \\n              (1)  The condition indicated by the classification \\n                   certificate; \\n \\n              (2)  What surveys have been accomplished relative to the \\n                   current certificate; \\n \\n              (3)  When and by whom the surveys were held; and \\n \\n              (4)  How complete they were. \\n \\n              In summary, the Commandant's acceptance of ABS standards, \\n              plans and specifications, and certificates may assist \\n              inspection personnel in carrying out their functions, but \\n              it does not relieve them of their responsibilities for \\n              the inspection of vessels.  Although the Coast Guard \\n              works closely with ABS in certain areas of inspection, \\n              inspection personnel cannot accept an ABS certificate or \\n              expressions of opinion by ABS personnel as to the \\n              condition of an item as a blanket indication of statutory \\n              or regulatory requirements of laws and regulations. \\n \\n      2.  Standards Of Other Recognized Classification Societies . \\n          The inspection laws and regulations also permit acceptance \\n          of the standards of recognized classification societies \\n          other than ABS when approved by the Commandant.  When a \\n          vessel complies with these standards, the approved plans and \\n          classification certificates may be accepted as evidence of \\n          the structural efficiency of the hull and reliability of \\n          machinery, except as otherwise provided. \\n \\n      3.

The effective employment of surg e forces is a key element in being able to \\nhandle incidents that may require personnel or ex pertise that are not readily available at each \\nunit.  \\nB. Concept of Employment . The Coast Guard’s approach to ensuring effective surge operations \\nrelies on the use of Deployable Specialized Forces (DSFs), Deployable Support Elements \\n(DSEs), Emergency Response Teams (ERTs), m obile assets and active, reserve, and \\nauxiliary personnel qualified to perform additi onal duties during surge operations.  The Coast \\nGuard’s bench strength enables it to surge reso urces to meet the demands of incidents of \\nvarying size, scope, and technical complexity.  \\nC. RFF Process . \\n1. Request for Forces (RFF) .  \\na. RFF Support .  Reference (m) is the primary COMDTINST that addresses the process \\nfor obtaining personnel resources to meet su rge requirements.  Areas and DCMS have \\nadditional requirements for their assets: \\n(1) Area Resources .  RFFs for Area assets shall be  requested thro ugh the respective \\nchain of command using the command cente r network to the appropriate Area \\nCommand Center or, if activ ated, the Area IMT.  For emergent requests, units \\nshall contact the appropriate Area via mo st expeditious means for the requested \\ncapability.  The Area, in turn, shall build  a Critical Information Communications \\n(CIC)-like teleconference with all involved commands, ensuring that all \\ninvolved parties within the chain-of-c ommand are on the call and are able to \\nparticipate in the decision process.   \\n(2) DCMS Resources .  RFFs for DCMS DSE and ot her mission support, technical \\nspecialists from Service Centers and Logi stics Centers shall be requested from \\nthe DCMS Watch at DOL-4.  The DCMS Watch, in turn, shall build a CIC-like \\nteleconference with all involved commands. \\n(3) Other Agency Assets .  Requests for Assistance (RFA) for other agency \\nresources, i.e., NOAA Scientific Advisor, shall be requested per the RFF process \\ndescribed for area resources. \\nb. Force Deploymenet Planning & Execution (FDP&E) Support .  Reference (aa) is the \\nprimary COMDTINST that addresses the FDP&E process including procedures for \\nobtaining strategic lift in support of  CCDR or Service requirements. \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

SAROPS is the preferred method for planning \\ncoastal, oceanic and Great Lakes searches and shall be us ed in these regions whenever practicable . \\nIn the discussion that follows, the term “SAROPS” is used in two ways.  Sometimes it is used to describe \\nthe entire suite of SAR tools that have been implemented in the  Coast Guard’s  Common Mapping \\nFramework (CMF).   The CMF is based on the ArcGIS suite of geographic information system (GIS) \\nproducts.  The Coast Guard’s SAR tools are currently the only applications that have been implemented \\nwithin the CMF.  SAROPS is also one of the individual SAR tools.  Specifical ly, SAROPS in this \\ncontext consists of the Simulator (SIM) and the Planner.  Although there is some potential for confusion, \\nit should be clear from the context what is meant when the term “SAROPS” is used.  \\nThe SAROPS software is hosted on a number of “ser vers” around the Coast Guard that are  dedicated to \\nsupporting SAROPS and search planners.  These servers are accessed from Command Center standard \\nworkstations through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).  Information on SAROPS server locations and \\nnames is avai lable from the Command , Control and Communications Engineering Center (C 3CEN) in \\nPortsmouth, VA.  Once connected, users log in to a SAROPS server in exactly the same way they log \\nin to their standard workstations.  \\nH.4.1  Initiating  and Closing/Suspending  a SAROPS Case .   \\nBefore SAROPS can be used, the CMF must be initiated . Once the user logs in to a SAROPS \\nserver, they will find a CMF icon on the desktop.  Double -clicking this icon brings up the \\nCommon Mapping Framework.  The user will see toolbars with var ious buttons, a “Display” \\nwindow with “Layers”  (also called a “Table of Contents” or TOC in ArcGIS terminology),  a \\n“SAR Tools” window with a “Cases” folder that contains an “Untitled Case” followed by a \\nnumber of SAR tools , including SAROPS,  with folders w here data associated with u sing those \\ntools will be stored, and a large window showing a map of the world in Mercator projection.  \\nAt the bottom of the screen is a “time slider,” some empty data fields, and some buttons similar \\nto those found on sound or v ideo recording/playback devices.  Figure H -16 below shows the \\ninitial SAROPS screen.  \\nH.4.1.1  A new SAROPS case may now be initiated in one of two ways.   The user may right -click on \\nthe words “Untitled Case” and then select “Properties” to bring up the Case Properties win dow.  \\nAt this point the user shall  assign a meaningful Case Name.  Special characters  shall  not be \\nused  in case names.  Letters, numeral s, blanks, and the underscore are the only characters \\nthat should be entered  in this field since it will be used in various file names  created by \\nSAROPS.   The default status is “Open.”  The person opening the SAROPS case shall  enter \\nhis/her rank/rate and n ame in the “Opened By” field.   The Unit Case No. should be entered, \\nalong with the MISLE Case No.  If these data items are not available initially, the SMC must \\nrevisit this page as soon as practicable after they are available and enter them.   The \\nremainin g blank fields for location, nature of distress, number of persons and vessel/aircraft \\nID are self -explanatory and should be filled in.   Figure H -17 shows the Case Properties \\nwindow.   Contents of the Case Name, Location, and MISLE Case No. fields are used in the \\nSubject line of the SAROPS Search Action Plan (SAP) report.   “Number of Persons” is used \\nin Paragraph 1.C. of the SAP report.

Turn and \\nDrag (47 MLB)An effective method of transiting through head seas while staying in the\\npower-bandoftheenginesandpreservingbuilt up momentumis often referred\\nto as the “Turn and Drag” method. This method prevents launching while \\nsimultaneously avoiding the high-side of the wave. The procedures of the turn \\nand drag is below: \\n \\nStep Procedure\\n1 Approach an incomingwavewith the boat slightly angled toward\\nthe low side or shoulder.\\n2As thebowreaches thebaseofthe wave, simultaneously\\nreduce theup-swell throttle to “CLUTCH AHEAD”and\\nturn the helm fully to that same side. \\n3 Once the boat reaches the crest of the swell, power up thethrottle\\nyou were dragging and bringthehelm back to theangle required\\nto set theboat’s heading for the next swell. \\n4 Once the boat reaches the crest of the swell, power up thethrottle\\nyou were dragging and bringthehelm back to theangle required\\nto set theboat’s heading for the next swell. \\nLateral Transit in Steep Swells  \\nF.15. Steering Whenever possible, you should avoid steering a course parallel (broadside) to \\nheavy swells. Tack across the swells at an angle (30 to 40 degrees). If \\nnecessary, steer a zigzag course, making each leg as long as possible, and \\nadjust the boat speed for a safe and comfortable ride. Seas directly off the beam \\nof the boat can cause adverse rolling conditions.\\nWhen transiting parallel to the seas, the boat will tend to ride the contour of \\nthe wave surface. This means that the boat’s vertical axis will remain \\nperpendicular to the surface on which the boat is operated. A wave face of 20 \\ndegrees will cause a 20-degree heel. \\nF.16. Square Up If youmust take up acourse which places the boat beam-to the seas, it is vital \\nto remain vigilant against the incoming waves.  If at any point you see a swell \\nwhich can possibly steepen up or even break, you should not hesitate to square \\nup. Putting the bow of the boat into threatening seas is the best way to ensure \\ntotal control of your vessel and should never be viewed as the “wrong” course \\nof action. \\n '}, vector=None),\n",

The roles and responsibilities associated with civil rights \\ntraining are as follows : \\n(1) CRSPs develop triennial plans for delivery of civil rights training within their area \\nof responsibility and schedule the training sessions with the supervisor. They are \\nresponsible for conducting required civil rights training sessions each year in \\norder to ensure the comma nds meet the triennial training requirement, teaching an \\naverage of 30 participants in each session, not to exceed 40 participants. CRSPs \\nbrief the CO/OIC or supervisor prior to and after conducting training and may \\nprovide out-briefs. The CRSP is also r esponsible for confirming training \\nattendance and delivery, and ensuring that proper documentation of the training is \\nentered in TMT. \\n(2) The CO/OIC and s upervisor introduce the training, placing emphasis on their \\npersonal commitment to a workplace environmen t free of discrimination and \\nharassment.  The Command provides logistical support for training. \\n4.  Civil Rights Training for  Supervisors and Managers.  \\na. Purpose . Supervisors and managers must be aware of their specific civil rights- related \\nresponsibilities, wh ich are unique to their positions in the organization.  Civil rights \\ntraining for supervisors and managers provides information that is critical for effective implementation of their responsibilities with respect to EEO programs and prevention \\nor handling of EEO complaints, and in developing and maintaining an organizational culture that values diversity. \\nb. About Civil Rights Training for Supervisors and Managers .  Most civilian hiring \\ndecisions are made by managers and supervisors.  Awareness of civil rights program requirements and command affirmative program goals is required for all individuals in positions that impact the civilian workforce.  Additionally, since resolving complaints at the lowest level begins with the immediate supervisor, awareness of complaint processes and ADR is an essential tool for supervisors in preventing complaints by presenting alternatives to achieving timely resolution of the issues when they arise. Basic information presented in Civil Rights training for supervisors and managers \\nincludes: \\n(1) An overview of civil rights programs, including the Disability Employment \\nProgram, r easonable accommodation procedures, and SEP. \\n4-19 '}, vector=None),\n",

The \\ninternal (national) assessment is an evaluation of  our national system as performed within \\nthe Coast Guard.  Coast Guard personnel trained for this duty perform such assessment s at a \\nspecific level (unit or RCC).  \\n1.5.5.2  International SAR assessments are conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard at the request o f a \\nforeign government. Such requests from a foreign government may come directly to Coast \\nGuard Headquarters SAR Program Manager (Commandant (CG-SAR )) or may come \\nindirectly; e.g., through another U.S. agency, from IMO in accordance with an existing \\nMOU, or to another part within the Coast Guard.  An international SAR assessment is \\ntypically an evaluation of that country’s overall SAR service.  There are few people in the \\nCoast Guard with experience in conducting this type of assessment.  \\n1.5.5.3  All reque sts for an international SAR assessment shall be brought to the attention of \\nCommandant ( CG-SAR ).  Such assessments shall be conducted under the guidance \\nprovided in reference (b), Volume I, Chapter 5, which provides broad guidance and \\nAppendix H, National  Self-Assessment on Search and Rescue, which is a general \\nquestionnaire on arrangements to develop and provide SAR services.   \\n1.5.5.4  The U.S. SAR system has served as a model for many countries but should not be viewed as \\nthe exclusive way of providing SA R services.

Expending personnel resources for the \\n              inspection of public vessels not subject to interagency \\n              agreements is contrary to the Commandant\\'s policy.  The \\n              costs of such inspections include travel, per diem, \\n              subsistence, and standard salary costs.  These costs can be \\n              justified by the Commandant only when interagency agreements \\n              for inspection of public vessels have been made. \\n \\n          c.

Application for \\n                   inspection of a vessel shall be addressed to the \\n                   officer in charge, marine inspection (OCMI) in whose \\n                   zone the inspection is to be made. \\n \\n              (2)  Certificate Of Inspection (COI) .  Upon completion of \\n                   the inspection, and if requested, the OCMI shall issue \\n                   an appropriate COI, provided the vessel complies with \\n                   the applicable regulations.  If not, the OCMI shall \\n                   issue a list of deficiencies that must be corrected \\n                   prior to issuing a COI.  The government agency involved \\n                   may, upon request, be furnished a copy of the COI. \\n \\n      4.  Military Sealift Command (MSC), U.S. Navy .  The primary \\n          mission of MSC is to provide sealift support for the DOD.  In \\n          peacetime, MSC operates and maintains the Fleet Auxiliary Force           of tankers, ammunition and cargo ships, cable-laying ships,           seagoing tugs, support vessels for the Rapid Deployment Force, \\n          resupply vessels for fleet ballistic missile submarines, and \\n          scientific research vessels.  In wartime, MSC\\'s role expands to \\n          include naval control of shipping and contingency planning for \\n           convoying.  Commandant (G-REP) maintains a liaison officer with \\n          MSC\\'s Office of Strategic Mobility for planning purposes. \\n          Commandant (G-WPE) maintains liaison to develop port security \\n          plans and activities.  Formal agreements have been reached \\n          between the Commander, MSC and Commandant (G-M) for the \\n          measurement, inspection, and certification of MSC vessels (see \\n          volume II) of this manual). \\n      5.  U.S. Customs Service .  The Customs Service (Department of the \\n          Treasury) is responsible for the administration and enforcement \\n          of customs laws.  All Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, and \\n          petty officers are \"officers of the customs\" under 14  U.S.C. \\n          143 and 19 U.S.C. 1401(1), who may assist the Customs Service in \\n          law enforcement under the authority of 14 U.S.C. 2 and 89.  In \\n          turn, the Customs Service assists the Coast Guard in the \\n          enforcement of navigation and vessel inspection laws.  The \\n          Commissioner of Customs and the Commandant maintain special \\n          procedures to enforce specific laws, such as: \\n \\n          a.

When loose water shifts from side to side or forward and aft due to \\nturning, speed changes, or wave action, the vessel does not want to right itself. \\nThis causes a loss of stability. This can cause the vessel to capsize or sink.  \\n(see Figure 4-4 and Figure4-5 )\\nCorrective actions include:\\n(01) Minimize the number of partially filled tanks (fuel, water, or cargo); \\nballast with seawater as necessary, \\n(02) Prevent cargo such as aids to navigation equipment and rescue gear \\nfrom rolling back and forth on the deck, \\n(03) If possible, store cargo low and close to the centerline. \\nFigure 4-4 \\nEffects of Free Surface'}, vector=None),\n",

MISCELLANEOUS ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERNS \\n \\n  A.  Regulatory Development .  The regulations in subpart 1.05 of Title \\n      33, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) set forth basic procedures \\n      for preparing and publishing Coast Guard regulations (Titles 33, \\n      46, and 49, CFR).  Additional procedures are contained in the \\n      informal rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure \\n      Act (5 U.S.C. 553).  This act requires, in part, that before \\n      regulations are finalized they must normally be published in the \\n      Federal Register  as Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM\\'s), and \\n      that interested persons must be given an opportunity to comment \\n      on them.  Comments are usually submitted in writing, for \\n      inclusion in the official file on the proposed regulations, but \\n      may be presented orally if a public hearing is held. \\n \\n      1.  Publication In The Federal Register . \\n \\n           a.  Advance Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) .  When \\n               the Coast Guard has a need to gather information for \\n               anticipated regulations, or when early public \\n               involvement is appropriate, an ANPRM is published in the \\n               Federal Register .  The purposes of an ANPRM are to \\n               obtain early public input and to identify tentative or \\n               alternative courses of action that may be followed in \\n               preparing regulations. \\n \\n           b.  Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) .  When a course of \\n               action has been selected, an NPRM is published in the \\n               Federal Register .  An NPRM informs the public that the \\n               Coast Guard intends to issue \"Final Rules.\" This notice \\n               contains a draft of the rules, or a statement of their \\n               contents, and a statement of the major issues in and the \\n               reasons for the rules.  The public is usually given a \\n               minimum of 45 days to review the proposal and to provide \\n               written comments, with the address for submitting \\n               comments and the deadline for submittal stated in the \\n               notice.  If one or more public hearings are to be held, \\n               the time and place(s) of the hearing(s) are announced in \\n               the notice or in a subsequent notice of public hearing. \\n \\n|          c.  Final Rule .  Comments from hearings and written comments \\n|              are evaluated, and the Final Rule is published in the \\n               Federal Register .  On occasion, a determination is made, \\n               based upon comments received and additional \"in-house\" \\n               analysis, to withdraw the proposal or make major \\n               modifications to it before issuing a Final Rule.

For maritime SAR, sweep width corrected ( Wc) = sweep width uncorrected ( Wu) x \\nweather correction ( fw) x fatigue correction ( ff) x speed correction ( fv-aircraft only ). For land \\nsearches, see the IAMSAR Manual . Maritime sweep width tables are provided below. Factors \\naffecting sweep width are:  \\n(a) Search Object characteristics.  The object’s size, shape, color contrast and brightness \\ncontrast, and movement mus t be considered.  \\n(b) Meteorological Visibility.  The maximum range at which large unlighted objects such as \\nlandmasses can be seen constitutes meteorological visibility. Reduced visibility results in \\nreduced detectability and sweep width.  \\n(c) Terrain/Sea Conditions . Normally, the more level the terrain, the more effective a land \\nsearch can be. Trees, rock outcroppings, and other surface irregularities decrease search \\neffectiveness.  Similarly, characteristics of the water surface such as sea state, whitecaps, \\nwind s treaks, foam streaks, breaking seas, swell systems, salt spray, and sun reflections \\ndecrease search effectiveness over water. Over water sweep width decreases as wind speed \\nand signifi cant wave height increase.  \\n(d) Cloud Cover.  Visual sweep widths may be redu ced 10 to 20 percent by cloud cover above \\nthe SRU due to reduced surface illumination.  \\n(e) Search Altitude s for Aircraft . For many objects, the available sweep width tables indicate \\nthat sweep width increases slightly with increasing altitude up to 3,000 feet under ideal \\nconditions.  However, these figures should not be given undue regard as the smaller \\nincreases indicated a re generally within the estimation error of the methods used to create \\nthe tables.  For example, at 500 and 1,000 feet, the uncorrected sweep width for a four -\\nperson raft is given as 1.8 NM while at 1,500 and 2,000 feet the uncorrected sweep width \\nis given  as 1.9 NM.  The decision on what altitude to assign should not be based on the \\ndifference in the uncorrected sweep widths.  As a general rule, differences in sweep widths \\nof less than 10% should be ignored when making altitude assignment decisions.  Anoth er \\ngeneral rule is that the search altitude should not be so high that it is an appreciable fraction \\nof the corrected sweep width.    As altitude decreases, the search object passes more rapidly \\nthrough the scanner’s field of vision. This effect is most pr onounced at altitudes below 500 \\nfeet. Nevertheless, if a large number of objects are in the area, a low altitude is preferable \\nto reduce diversions for identifying sightings. Also, low altitude favors object identification \\nbecause scanners are more familia r with objects viewed from low angles. For maritime \\nsearches, the daylight lower limit is 200 feet for all search conditions, and altitude usually \\ndoes not exceed 3000 feet even under ideal search conditions. For land searches, scanner \\nefficiency decreases  rapidly as altitude increases from 200 feet up to 2000 feet, and more \\nslowly as it increases above 2000 feet. See Table H -8 for recommended search altitudes.  \\n(f) Search Speed.  At low altitudes, higher speed causes blurring of search objects at close \\nranges and decreases exposure time to the scanner, which can significantly reduce sweep \\nwidth. At altitudes above 500 feet, search speed of traditional SRUs has less influence on \\nover water sweep widths.  \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

The SLO \\nfacilitates Auxiliary use to supplement State efforts in search and rescue, \\nsafety and regatta patrols, PE, VSCs, verification of Stat e maintained AtoN, \\nand other areas of RBS.  \\nB.13.f.(1)  \\nAppointment of \\nSLO DCOs are responsible for supporting this program by appointing an \\nAuxiliarist from each State in the district/region in close coordination with \\nthe Director, the district State Bo ating Law Administrator (BLA), the \\nDistrict RBS Specialist, and the Aux iliary’s Director for RBS Outreach \\n(DIR-B).  Those States w ithin more than one district or region must have a \\nsingle SLO acceptable to all DCOs.  There should not be more than one SLO \\nper State unless State requested.  DCOs should coordinate this \\nrecommendation with Directors within their respective dist rict/region.  The \\nAuxiliarist appointed to serve as a SL O should be an individual well versed \\nin the State’s boating laws and regula tions and who resides in reasonably \\nclose proximity to BLA Headquarters.  This Auxiliarist must be capable of \\neffective communications with electe d and appointed officials regarding \\nState boating law issues.  \\nB.13.f.(2)  SLO \\nDuties The SLO’s duty is not to interpret Coas t Guard policy.  Matters in discussion \\nwith BLA, not having specific Coast Guar d guidance, must be referred to the \\nDirector.

Procedures For Maintaining Professional Credentials . \\n \\n      1.  Commercial Vessel Operational Experience .  Professionalism in \\n          the marine safety field means more than having acquired \\n          certain skills and knowledge.  It means having acquired \\n          experience, having maintained recency of experience, and \\n          having developed a \"hands-on\" feel for the priorities, \\n          concerns, and challenges of the industry we regulate.  For \\n          these reasons, individuals will be encouraged to check ride \\n          a commercial vessel at least once every 2 years, while \\n          assigned to a marine safety district or field billet, to \\n          maintain familiarity and proficiency in marine safety \\n          programs.  These \"check rides\" will usually be conducted in \\n          conjunction with an underway midperiod inspection. \\n \\n      2.  Professional Readings .  Sharing one\\'s expertise with \\n          colleagues marks an individual as a leader; not because the \\n          person is the most knowledgeable in the area, but is willing \\n          to make the effort to research, organize, and pass this \\n          information to others.  It is as much an issue of community \\n          responsibility as professional enhancement.  The \\n          professional reading is a formal presentation to a group or \\n          organization on a professional topic.  It need not be based \\n          on a formal paper or published article.

Safety Program  \\nIntroduction The fundamental reasons for a comprehensive aviation safety program \\nare the well -being of personnel and the preservation of limited resources, \\nwith the goal of conducting flight operations in the safest possible manner consistent with mission requirements.  To achieve this goal, the Coast \\nGuard safety program establishes organizational requirements to identify \\nhazardous situations, take corrective actions to reduce risks and/or \\neliminate danger, and disseminate information to promote the safety and occupational health of military and civilian personnel. Reference ( f) \\nprovides specific guidance for the flight safety program.  \\nIn this Section  This section contains the following information:  \\nTitle  Page  \\nExchange of Safety Information  13-2 \\nCommand Emphasis  13-2 \\nCrew Participation  13-2 \\nRequests for Grounding  13-3 \\n \\nA.1. Exchange of \\nSafety Information  Free and open exchange of operational hazard assessments, risk \\nmanagement tools, crew/maintenance resource management activities, \\nand mishap reports to inform all parties on effective mission \\naccomplishment are vital to safe operations.  \\nA.2. Command \\nEmphasis  Effective aviation safety requires continuous command emphasis and \\nleadership. If hazards are recognized and effectively reduced or \\neliminated, mishap potential will be re duced, and the operational \\neffectiveness of the air unit will be enhanced. Experience has shown that a strong command mishap prevention (loss control) policy will reduce \\naircraft mishap potential and thereby enhance overall mission \\neffectiveness.  \\nA.3. Crew  \\nParticipation  Each individual connected with air operations, whether in an operational \\nor supporting role (e.g., flight crew, scheduling, maintenance), \\ncontributes directly to the effectiveness of the aviation safety program. Effective safety is a team ef fort and requires the active participation of all \\nhands. Specific responsibilities and requirements are prescribed in \\nreference ( f). \\n  '}, vector=None),\n",

Crisis Action Planning Activities .  CAP encompasses the activities associated with the \\ntime-sensitive development of orders for th e deployment, employment, and sustainment \\nof Coast Guard forces and capabilities in response  to a threat or hazards.  Like deliberate \\nplanning, detailed in Reference (f), CAP is  guided by JOPP or DPDP.  They are similar \\nto deliberate planning activ ities, but while deliberate  planning is conducted in \\nanticipation of potential threat s and hazards, CAP is based on actual circumstances that \\nexist at the time planning occurs.  CAP conde nses and accelerates the planning process to \\nensure the timely preparation of COAs for consideration by a higher headquarters \\n(HHQ), and the prompt transmission of d ecisions to the supported commander and \\nsubordinate units. CAP activities may be perf ormed sequentially or in parallel, with \\nsupporting and subordinate plans or Oper ation Orders (OPORD) being developed \\nconcurrently. CAP can use plans developed in deliberate planning for a similar threat or \\nhazard. The commander converts these plans to executable OPORDs or develops \\nOPORDs from scratch when no useful deliberat e plan exists.  Refer to References (r) \\nthrough (t) which provide detailed CAP pla nning policies, procedures, and formatting \\nguidance. \\nL. International Response Operations . \\n1. Coast Guard Support .  In an internationa l civil response, such as the relief efforts \\nfollowing the major earthquake that devastated  Haiti in 2010, Coast Guard assistance is \\nnormally coordinated through the United States (U.S.) Department of State (DOS) or the \\nU.S. Agency for International Developmen t (USAID).  The DOS or USAID may also \\nreceive support from other federal agenci es, DOD, and NGOs.  The Coast Guard will \\nintegrate its response efforts with the overa ll response organization.  The Coast Guard \\nmay provide support through the DOD Forei gn Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster \\nResponse missions.  Finally, the Coast Guard ma y also engage under its own authorities. \\nUSAID is the lead U.S. Government agency for coordination of U.S. Government foreign \\ndisaster assistance.  The Coast Guard is th e lead U.S. Government agency for maritime \\nsearch and rescue, and maritime safety operations.  USAID and the Coast Guard agree that collaboration on foreign di saster assistance operations is mutually beneficial.  \\nUSAID and the Coast Guard have worked toge ther in the past to respond to foreign \\ndisasters.  See the most recent Memorandum  of Understanding between Coast Guard and \\nUSAID, which can be found in Appendix B of this Manual. \\nIn the event that the USCG is the lead federal agency on an incident for which \\ninternational offers of assist ance are presented, the DCO, in  coordination with DOS, shall \\nmanage implementation, coordination, and execu tion of all international assistance.  If \\nnecessary, a Critical Resources Unit (CRU) sha ll be established at the national level and \\nset up as two divisions:  an International Offers of Assi stance Branch and a National \\nResources Acquisitions Branch.   \\n2. International Offers of Assistance\\n.  When considering interna tional offers of assistance, \\nadditional coordination is requir ed to ensure applicable legal issues are vetted prior to \\nacceptance of those resources.  The CRU sh all coordinate with the UAC CRU, if \\nestablished, DCO, and the DOS to manage a nd track offers of resources and equipment '}, vector=None),\n",

Coast Guard units are also called \\nto rescue animals  other then pets  stranded due to natural causes.   \\n4.16.2  Rescuing Pets during  SAR Operations  \\nWhen feasible, Coast Guard units should conduct pet rescues when their owners are rescued.  \\n4.16.2.1  Authority .  The person in charge of the rescue unit (pilot in command, boat coxswain, and \\ncutter commanding officer)  has the final decision authority to rescue the animal or not.  The \\ndecision to rescue the animal should take into consideration:  \\n(a) The space on the vessel or aircraft available to accommodate  the animal;  \\n(b) Rescue unit c rew’s ability to safely transfer the animal;  \\n(c) Risk to the crew/victims to stay on scene and render aid;  \\n(d) Risk to the crew/victims if the animal is brought on board;  \\n(e) Ability of the animal to survive on the vessel until other rescuers can arrive to perform the \\nanimal recovery.   \\n4.16.2. 2 Assessment of Risk .  The SAR unit should not be placed at increased r isk solely for the \\npurpose of pet rescue.  \\n(a) Typically, when a vessel is in distress, the weather conditions in which a vessel is in \\ndistress are not ideal.  \\n(b) The transport of animals in SAR facilities can pose a problem based on size, health and \\ntempe rament of the animal being rescued.  \\n4.16.2. 3 Animal preparation.   Animals are under a lot of stress and may bite or attack strangers out \\nof fear.  If there is time vessel owners  should be  directed to  prepare the animal for rescue.  For \\nexample, request tha t the animal be muzzled, kenneled, leashed, etc.  This will not only assist \\nthe rescue but will make the rescue safer for the crew.  \\n4.16.2.4  If pets cannot be rescued then their location shall be provided to animal rescue services for \\npossible separate recovery of the pets.  \\n4.16. 3 Rescuing Animals from the Water    \\nThere may be times when a call for assistance is made to rescue a n animal  from the water , \\ne.g. on floating debris, adrift vessel s, ice floes, weak ice, or caught in a rip tide when \\nswimming .    \\n4.16.3.1  SMC’s shall work with local authorities to render assistance .  The marine police, DNR, \\nanimal services, etc. may be better equipped and in a better position to rescue the animal.   \\n4.16.3.2  Coast Guard units should only assist when requested by l ocal authorities, on a not to interfere \\nwith primary mission basis.  This assistance will normally be limited to provid ing a platform \\nfrom which the local authorities (animal services) can perform the rescue.    '}, vector=None),\n",

Amver’s primary function is to quickly provide SAR authorities with accurate \\nposition information and characteristics of ships near  a reported maritime or aviation distress \\nthat may be able to provide assistance.  Vessels of all nations, on coastal or oceanic voyages, \\nanywhere in the world, are encouraged to participate by reporting their position to Amver.  \\nAmver -participating vessel s are typically merchant vessels, but can also include mega -\\nyachts, commercial fishing vessels, or any other vessel capable of providing assistance.  \\nVessels participate by sending movement reports (e.g., sailing plan, periodic position \\nupdates, and final report) to the Amver Center at OSC via assigned coast or international \\nradio stations or satellite service providers.  Information from these reports is entered into a \\ndatabase that computes dead reckoning positions for vessels anywhere in the world while \\nthey are participating in the system.  Vessel characteristics valuable for determining SAR \\ncapability from other available sources of information will be accessed through Amver.  \\n1.7.4.1 Position information and ship SAR characteristics within the area of interest are made \\navailable to recognized SAR authorities of any nation for use during a SAR case.   \\n1.7.4.2 Because vessel movement information provided to Amver is considered proprietar y \\ncommercial or financial information, it should be carefully guarded from external release and \\nhandled in accordance with the specific guidelines in reference ( k) and reference ( n). \\nPredicted locations or Amver information are disclosed only for safety pu rposes; it should  \\nnot be provided to Coast Guard personnel in other mission areas (e.g., law enforcement, \\nmaritime investigations) nor other types of agencies.

Knockdown and Rollover Causes\\nIntroduction Knockdowns and Rollovers have occurred in a wide variety of situations, and \\neach is somewhat unique.  A roll will generally occur when a boat is placed \\nbeam-to or broaches in a breaker the same height as the beam of the boat.  The \\noperator’s actions at this point can determine whether or not the boat is spared.  \\nSome knockdowns/rollovers have occurred in lesser conditions and cases of \\nopen ocean knockdowns/rollovers have been documented.  The steepness of \\nthe wave is as dangerous as its height.  Any situation that places the center of \\ngravity over the center of buoyancy can result in a knockdown/rollover.  A \\nlifeboat operator must be constantly aware of the sea conditions and take \\naction to avoid being caught beam-to or broaching\\nNOTE\\nIn this Section This section contains the following information:\\nTitle See Page\\nKnockdown or Rollover 6-97\\nProcedures fora Knockdown/ Rollover 6-98\\nContinuing or Returning 6-99\\nThe terms “Knockdown” and “Rollover” apply specifically to self-righting boats.  A knockdown is when \\na boat has rolled in one direction 90º or greater but does not completely rollover (360º) to right itself. \\n(Example: Boat rolls to port 120º and rights itself by rolling back to starboard.)  A rollover occurs when \\na boat rolls in one direction and rights itself by completing a 360º revolution.'}, vector=None),\n",

Depth \\nSounderThere are several types of depth sounders, but they operate on the same \\nprinciple.  The depth sounder is the most accurate way to determine the depth \\nof water. The depth sounder transmits a high frequency sound wave that \\nreflects off the bottom and returns to the receiver.  The “echo” is converted to \\nan electrical impulse and can be read on a depth sounder display.  It shows \\nonly the depth of water the vessel is in.  Depth sounders can be set to fathoms \\n(one fathom = 6 feet), feet, or meters. Ideally the units displayed should be the \\nsame as those of the chart being used.\\nC.8.a.  \\nTransducerThe transducer is the part of the depth sounder that transmits the sound wave . \\nIt is usually mounted permanently in the bottom or under the transom on the \\ncentreline.  Transducers, if installed, are not always located at the lowest point \\nof a boat. The distance from the transducer to the lowest point of the hull must \\nbe known. This distance must be subtracted from the depth sounding reading \\nto determine the actual depth of water available.\\nExample:  Depth sounder reading is 6 feet. The transducer is 1 foot above the \\nlowest point of the hull - the boat extends 1 foot below the transducer. This 1 \\nfoot is subtracted from the reading of 6 feet, which means the boat has 5 feet \\nof water beneath it.\\nC.8.b. Offset Offset is a function available in most depth sounders.  Its purpose is to \\ncompensate for the display of available depth from the sensor location on the \\nhull to the actual lowest point of the vessel ( Figure 3-39 ). When the offset \\nvalue is reading correctly, zero ft beneath the keel means the lowest part of \\nthe vessel is touching the bottom, even though the actual transducer location \\nmay be several feet from the bottom. \\nFigure 3-38\\nOffset'}, vector=None),\n",

Performance Effective performance depends on both technical performance and \\ninterpersonal skills.  \\nB.2. Focus  CRM focuses on crewmember attitudes and behaviours. A primary focus \\nof CRM is effective team coordination. The team encompasses the flight crew, air traffic controllers, maintenance, and other groups that interact with the cockpit crew. Effective CRM involves the entire flight crew. CRM is not simply the responsibility of the PIC, nor should CRM be \\nviewed as pilot training. All crewmembers are responsible for the \\neffective management of the resources available to  them.  \\nB.3. Acquisition of \\nCRM Skills  The acquisition of effective CRM skills requires the active participation of all \\ncrewmembers.

Burden Of Proof .  The burden of proof that a \\n               vessel has a valid claim of force majeure rests \\n               with the vessel, its master and owner.  A claim \\n               of force majeure is supported only by the \\n               existence of overwhelming conditions or forces of \\n               such magnitude (e.g., severe storm, fire, \\n               disablement, mutiny) that they threaten the loss \\n               of the vessel, crew, or cargo unless immediate \\n               corrective action is taken.  Conversely, an \\n               invalid claim of force majeure has no effect on \\n               the authority of the coastal state to take all \\n               appropriate law enforcement action against an \\n               entering vessel. \\n        \\n            4. COTP Authority .   Each Coast Guard COTP, and the \\n               district commander, has the authority to verify \\n               and then accept or reject claims of force majeure \\n               for the purposes of enforcing applicable laws. \\n               Even if a vessel exhibits a valid force majeure \\n               claim, the COTP may nevertheless take action to \\n               remove a hazard to life or property under the \\n               authority of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act \\n               (33 USC 1221 et seq.). For example, in the event \\n               of fire, flooding, or collision damage which may \\n               affect the safety of a vessel or its cargo the \\n               COTP would ascertain the condition of the vessel, \\n               determine the existence of any hazard to the \\n               port, and make any COTP order consistent with the \\n               right of entry under force majeure and the \\n               protection of the port.  The COTP may direct the \\n               vessel to a specific location and not to the port \\n               of their choice.  However, once a force majeure \\n               claim has been validated, the Coast Guard alone \\n               is the Federal agency responsible for granting or \\n               denying vessel entry. \\n       G.  Layup Of Commercial Vessels . \\n        \\n           1.  Introduction .  In early 1975 the Coast Guard began \\n               receiving inquiries regarding the layup of foreign \\n               tank vessels in U.S. waters.  These inquiries \\n               ranged from Maine to California and concerned \\n               vessels from 28,000 to 250,000 deadweight tons \\n               (DWT).  Due to a surplus of tank vessels in the \\n               international market, it was anticipated that the \\n               owners and operators of foreign tank vessels would \\n               seek to take advantage of the superior anchorage \\n               areas available in U.S. waters.  Under 33 USC 471, \\n               33 USC 1221, and 50 USC 191, the Coast Guard has \\n               certain responsibilities regarding the anchorage \\n               and movement of vessels, the protection of \\n               vessels, bridges, or other structures on or in the \\n               navigable waters of the United States, or any land \\n               structure or shore area immediately adjacent to \\n               those waters, and the protection of navigable \\n               waters and their resources from environmental harm \\n               resulting from vessel or structure damage, \\n               destruction or loss. \\n        \\n        \\n \\n       CH-3                          1-28 '}, vector=None),\n",

Check them \\nregularly to be sure that it is adequate, in good repair, and that all \\nsignalling devices work. \\n(05)Be ready to grab a sturdy support to prevent being thrown about.\\n(06) Cold water decreases the length of time most people can hold their \\nbreath underwater.

In theory, if you remain upright, you will be able to walk out of \\nthe boat on the overhead which is now acting as the deck. In most \\ncases it will be difficult to remain upright and therefore your PFD \\nmay “pin” you to the overhead (deck). Consider removing PFD if \\nnecessary.\\n '}, vector=None),\n",

Authority Of The District Commander .  Under 33 CFR 100, the \\n      district commander may promulgate special local regulations for a \\n      regatta or marine parade.  These regulations may include \\n      restrictions and controls over vessel movement immediately \\n      before, during, and immediately after the event, and may also \\n      establish any aids to navigation necessary for the observance and \\n      enforcement of those special local regulations.  Guidance on \\n      establishing special local regulations is found in COMDTINST \\n      M16704.2 Series.  The district commander may detail Coast Guard \\n      vessels to patrol the course of a regatta or marine parade for \\n      the purpose of enforcing special local regulations, providing \\n      assistance, and enforcing laws in general.  Coast Guard Auxiliary \\n      and private vessels may be employed subject to the restrictions \\n      imposed in 33 CFR 100.40. Because of the number of marine events \\n      held annually and resource limitations, the use of Coast Guard \\n      vessels is limited to those events which may be expected to \\n      introduce extra or unusual hazards, or to impede the normal flow \\n      of marine traffic. \\n   \\n      a.  Concurrent Jurisdiction .  Where concurrent federal/state \\n          jurisdiction exists, the district commander is authorized \\n          under 33 CFR 100.10 to enter into agreements with state \\n          authorities to permit them to review applications and issue \\n          permits for certain events when it is clearly within the \\n          capabilities of the state to do so.  Such agreements are in \\n          keeping with the Commandant\\'s policy of encouraging the \\n          states to assume a greater role in boating safety, and are \\n          encouraged. \\n   \\n      b.  Establishment Of Temporary Aids To Navigation .  The district \\n          commander may establish temporary aids to navigation and \\n          authorize private aids to navigation to mark marine parades \\n          or regattas (see 33 CFR 100.45).     Such markers are not \\n          considered \"aids to navigation\" for the Coast Guard\\'s \\n          purposes, as long as the following conditions are met: \\n   \\n          (1)  They are established for a marine event of a specified \\n               and limited duration authorized by the Coast Guard and \\n               not for general navigational use; \\n   \\n          (2)  They are established to mark turning points, a slalom \\n               course, or other lanes of restriction to participants; \\n               and \\n   \\n          (3)  They do not display the characteristics prescribed for \\n               the lateral or Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) marker \\n               systems. \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                            1-31                              CH-3 '}, vector=None),\n",

Therefore, \\nwhen considering whether or not to take this action, the factors that are considered in \\nOperational Risk Management for SAR planning should serve as a model for evaluating the \\nrisk to the civilian mariner and the necessity for ordering such a compelled evacuation.  These \\nfactors include the on scene environmental conditions, the presence of a hazardous bar, shoals \\nor ot her hazardous obstruction, the condition of the mariner’s vessel, available Coast Guard \\nresources, the fitness and experience of the Coast Guard personnel on scene and the expertise \\nof the authority ordering the evacuation.  \\n \\n4.2.4  Decision Authority  \\n \\nThe d ecision to force or compel mariners to abandon their vessels should normally be made \\nby the cognizant SAR Coordinator (SC).

Another reason for a linear \\ndeployment would be to accommodate a missing craft’s intended track.  However, \\nunless the track line is short or the missing  craft’s pre -distress speed is large (as \\nwith an aircraft, for example), the times involved may dictate deployment along a \\npath (possibly curved or even crooked) to accommodate where the search object \\nmay have drifted from various points along the intended  track up to the time of \\nSLDMB deployment.  \\nc. “X” Pattern.  In situations where it is unclear whether the major surface current \\ninfluence is parallel or perpendicular to a given feature, such as the shoreline, it \\nmay be appropriate to deploy SLDMBs in an “ X” pattern so that transects along \\nthe two perpendicular ax is are obtained.  \\nd. Generalized Pattern.   In areas where surface currents are expected to exhibit \\nconsiderable complexity due to a complex shoreline, complex bottom topography, \\nriver outflows, and/or tidal influences, a less geometrically regular deployment \\npattern than those given above may be appropriate.  In such cases, detailed local \\nknowledge from reliable sources can be an invaluable aid for determining the best \\nplacement of SLDMBs.  \\ne. Multiple Scenarios .  The deployment strategy for cases with multiple scenarios \\nshould be to cover all the scenarios using the patterns  suggested above . \\n(3) Spacing.  Spacing between multiple SLDMBs is dependent upon the situation .  The \\noptimal spacing ranges from 3 nm for near -shore cases with strong tidal currents to 6 \\nnm for offshore  cases in  regions that la ck significant open ocean currents.  However, \\nthe number of SLDMBs that can be made available in combination with the size of \\nthe area of interest may dictate larger spacing.  For larger spacing, more care is needed \\nto determine the best deployment locatio ns.  During the latter stages of a multi -day \\ncase, additional SLDMBs should be deployed to fill the gaps between the existing \\nSLDMBs and to seed the area down -drift.  \\n(4) Other Sources.   Most surface current data for search planning comes from either \\nmodels  that are updated with observations from a variety of sources (which may or \\nmay not have direct observational data for the region and time of SAR interest), or \\nfrom climatological databases or atlases.  In both cases it is generally necessary to \\ndeploy SLD MBs to get better data for the area of interest.  In the (presently rare) event \\nthat reliable direct observations are available from other sources in some parts of the \\nregion of interest, it may be more beneficial to deploy SLDMBs elsewhere rather than \\nduplicate the efforts of these other sources.  As the ability to assimilate SLDMB data \\ninto oceanographic models in a timely fashion improves, it will be possible to realize \\nthe benefits of both direct observation and modeling with minimal or no impact on the  \\nsearch planner beyond directing the deployment of the SLDMBs as needed. However, \\nfor the present time SLDMB -based surface current data will generally take precedence \\nin the vicinity of the SLDMBs over data from other sources.  \\n(e) Incidents in remote areas  present additional difficulties.  Deployment of an SLDMB in \\nan initial sortie is particularly critical due to the likely delay in additional sorties and the \\nneed to maximize searching during those sorties.  Delaying until a later sortie to deploy \\nan SLDMB  can add hours to the delay in receiving critical sea current data.  Dropping \\nmore then one in case of failure should also be considered for very remote area insertions.  '}, vector=None),\n",

Description Tide is the vertical rise and fall of the ocean water level caused by the \\ngravitational attraction of the sun and moon. A tidal current is the horizontal \\nmotion of water resulting from the change in the tide. It is different from \\nocean currents, river currents, or those created by the wind. Tidal currents are \\nof particular concern in boat operations.\\nNOTE\\nB.13. Flood, Ebb, \\nand Slack \\nCurrentsFlood current is the horizontal motion of water toward the land, caused by a \\nrising tide. Ebb current is the horizontal motion away from the land, caused \\nby a falling tide. Slack water is the period that occurs while the current is \\nchanging direction and has no horizontal motion.\\nAn outgoing or ebb current running across a bar builds up a more intense sea \\nthan the incoming or flood current. The intense sea results because the rush \\nof water out against the incoming ground swell slows the wave speed and \\nsteepens the wave prematurely.\\nB.14. Longshore \\nCurrentsLongshore currents run parallel to the shore and inside the breakers. They are \\nthe result of the water transported to the beach by the waves.\\nCAUTION !\\nB.15. Eddy \\nCurrentsEddy currents (eddies) occur at channel bends, near points of land, and at \\nplaces where the bottom is uneven.\\nCAUTION !\\nB.16. Wind \\nEffects on \\nCurrentWind affects the speed of currents.  Sustained wind in the same direction as \\nthe current increases the speed of the current by a small amount.  Wind in the \\nopposite direction slows it down and may create a chop.  A very strong wind, \\nblowing directly into the mouth of an inlet or bay, can produce an unusually \\nhigh tide by piling up the water.  Similarly, a very strong wind blowing out \\nof a bay can cause an unusually low tide and change the time of the high or \\nlow tide.\\nB.17. Effects on \\nBoat SpeedWhen going with the current, a boat’s speed over ground is faster than the \\nspeed/RPM indication.  When going against the current, a boat’s speed over \\nground is slower than the speed/RPM indication.\\nCurrent direction is the compass heading toward which the water moves.\\nWatch for and avoid eddies.  They can abruptly change speed and steering control of boats.\\nPay close attention to longshore currents. They can cause a boat to broach or the object of a search to\\nmove further than expected.'}, vector=None),\n",

INCIDENT MANAGEMENT ORG ANIZATIONAL ROLES AND \\nRESPONSIBILITIES \\nA. Introduction .  The basic tenet of Incident Management in the Coast Guard is to manage \\nincidents at the lowest possible level in the organization and support t hose efforts from each \\nlevel of the organization.  In keeping with that  tenet, this Chapter describes the role of the \\nvarious organizational levels and function in the Coast Guar d and how each supports the \\nconduct of incident management activities. \\nB. Coast Guard Response Requirements .  The Coast Guard shall have  the capability to sustain \\nincident response operations for two concurrent  Type 1 incidents for up to 3 months and \\nadditionally Type 3 incidents for up to 30 days in each Sector’s area of  responsibility.  Coast \\nGuard response expectations are derived from historical incident da ta and lessons learned \\nfrom incidents and exercises. \\nC. Sectors .  Sectors maintain command and control of  Coast Guard tactical level operations.  \\nSectors also provide a focal point for Coast Guard coordina tion, outreach, and integration \\nwith local and state governments.   \\n1. Sector Roles .  Sector commanders serve as the Fe deral On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), \\nFederal Maritime Security Coordinator (FMSC) , Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator \\n(SMC), Officer In Charge Marine Inspections  (OCMI), and Captain of the Port (COTP).  \\nInteragency and stakeholder communities rely on the Coast Guard’s day-to-day \\nleadership to ensure that preparedness and response activities for the ports and waterways \\nremain effective in complex operational por t environments.  Effective response is \\nfounded on healthy relationships within the po rt.  Therefore, Sect ors shall participate \\nactively with the local and state emergency planning communities to  jointly plan for, \\nexercise, and execute disaster response operatio ns.  In the event of larger, more complex \\nincidents, sector commanders shall request appropriate support re sources as the next \\nlogical source of incident  management support.   \\na. ICS Coordinator .  Every sector commander shall designate an ICS coordinator to \\nfacilitate and manage the ICS program at the Sector.  The responsibilities of the ICS \\ncoordinator are to: \\n(1) Brief personnel assigned to a Watch Quarter Station Bill (WQSB) position on \\ntheir training requirements and re sponsibilities for that position. \\n(2) Assist the command in the developm ent and maintenance of a unit ICS \\ninstruction. \\n(3) Assist the command in the development and maintenance of the unit WQSB as \\noutlined in Chapter 5 of this Manual. \\n(4) In coordination with the unit training officer, provide input for unit needs for \\nICS training for incorporation into the unit training plan. \\n(5) Work with unit training officer to ente r electronic training requests (ETR) into \\nDA for personnel needing “C” school training. \\n(6) Work with the course POC when an expor table ICS course is scheduled at their \\nsector to ensure logistics needs are ta ken care of, including classroom setup and \\ndocumentation required for units hosting an exportable course.

Short \\nNotice A last-minute decision to pa rticipate in a mission, or pa rticipation in response \\nto a short-notice request for assistance, does not relieve an Auxiliarist from \\nattempting to make advance notificati on.  For example, a VE who plans to \\nrespond to a web-based request for a VS C the following day should still, as a \\nminimum, attempt to advise the FSO-VE in advance.  Advance verbal or \\ne-mail notice of intent, even if not acknowledged, constitutes Auxiliary unit \\nlevel awareness for this purpose. \\nJ.6.c.  Failure to \\nNotify Failure to attempt to appropriately atta in unit-level awareness in accordance \\nwith these provisions may jeopardize an Auxiliarist’ s recognition as having \\nbeen properly assigned to duty, implicitly or otherwise, and may place an \\nAuxiliarist at considerable risk in terms of subsequent reimbursements, scope \\nof employment determinations, and liability coverage. \\nJ.7.  Use of \\nPrivate Motor \\nVehicles Auxiliarists are authorized to use private motor vehicles for authorized \\nAuxiliary activities without Coast Guard orders unless they plan to seek \\nreimbursement for expenses.  In addi tion to routine travel to and from \\nauthorized activities, private motor vehi cles may be used in the performance \\nof other authorized activities such as participation in parades (i.e., towing a \\nboat or a float), performing a ch art updating mission, or conducting \\nenvironmental activities.  Coast Guard orders are required if a motor vehicle \\nis being used as a land mobile radio or radio direction findi ng facility or in \\nthe performance of AtoN or shoreside harbor patrol missions.  Appropriate \\norders and contingency (pocket) orders may be issued to operators of fixed \\nland and land mobile radio and ra dio direction finding facilities.  \\nJ.8.

Bar Keel The bar keel is popular because its stiffeners (vertical or upright members \\nwhich increase strength) protect the boat’s hull plating if the boat grounds on \\na hard bottom. It also reduces rolling. A disadvantage of the bar keel is that it \\nincreases the boat’s draft, because it extends below the bottom of the boat.\\nB.12.b.  Flat \\nPlate KeelThe flat plate keel has a plate that is perpendicular to the centerline of the hull.  \\nA vertical center keel that runs internal to the hull at the centerline typically \\nsupports the flat plate keel.  The vertical center keel is often provided with a \\nflange top so that when combined with the flat plate keel the section resembles \\nan “I” beam.\\nPrinciple Boat Parts\\nB.13. Bow The shape of a boat’s bow, its profile, form, and construction determine hull \\nresistance as the boat advances through the water. Hull resistance develops \\nfrom friction and from the wave the hull makes as it moves in the water. Wave-\\nmaking resistance depends on the boat’s speed. \\nThe bow of a boat must be designed with enough buoyancy so it lifts with the \\nwaves and does not cut through them. The bow flare provides this buoyancy.  \\nBoats intended for operation in rough seas and heavy weather have “full” \\nbows. The bow increases th e buoyancy of the forward part of a boat and \\ndeflects water and spray. When a boat is heading into a wave, the bow will \\ninitially start to cut into the wave. It may be immersed momentarily if the seas \\nare rough. As the bow flare cuts into the wave, it causes the water to fall away \\nfrom a boat’s stern, shifting the center of buoyancy to move forward from the \\ncenter of gravity. The bow lifts with the wave and the wave passes under the \\nboat, shifting the center of buoyancy aft. This action causes the bow to drop \\nback down and the vessel achieves a level attitude.\\nB.14. Stern The shape of the stern affects the speed, resistance, and performance of the \\nboat. It also affects the way water is forced to the propellers.\\nThe design of the stern is critical in following seas where the stern is the first \\npart of a boat to meet the waves. If the following waves lift the stern too high, \\nthe bow may be buried in the sea. The force of the wave will push the stern \\ncausing it to pivot around toward the bow. If this is not controlled, the result \\ncan be that a boat broaches or pitch poles.'}, vector=None),\n",

(cont'd) Executive Order (E.O.) 12498 and implementing \\n              directives, then pursuit of that regulatory action must \\n              be approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) \\n              and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for \\n              inclusion in the administration's regulatory program. \\n              When a workplan is prepared for a regulation classified \\n              as significant under DOT policies and procedures for \\n              simplification, analysis, and review of regulations \\n              (DOT Order 2100.5 of 22 May 1985), the Commandant must \\n              approve the workplan.  A member of the Chief Counsel's \\n              staff assists the project manager in drafting the \\n              proposed rules.  This draft is then evaluated by all \\n              appropriate Headquarters staffs, and is cleared as \\n              directed by the Marine Safety Council. \\n \\n          c.  Docketing Of Proposals .  All rulemaking projects \\n              initiated at Headquarters are docketed by the Executive \\n              Secretary of the Marine Safety Council.  The assigned \\n              docket number remains with the project until the \\n              rulemaking procedure is completed.  All documents \\n              associated with the project are filed by the Executive \\n              Secretary under that docket number and are available for \\n              inspection and copying by the public.  After the \\n              proposed rule has been cleared, it is signed by the \\n              Commandant or the Office chief and published in the \\n              Federal Register.  After public comments have been \\n              evaluated, the Final Rule document is drafted and \\n              cleared as described above. \\n \\n      4.  Regulatory Correspondence .  Whenever Coast Guard personnel \\n          believe that a particular regulation is not in the best \\n          interest of safety or protection of the environment or that \\n          an additional regulation is needed, that situation should be \\n          brought to the attention of Commandant (G-M) via the chain \\n          of command.  This is particularly desirable for regulations \\n          that have been misinterpreted or appear to place an \\n          unreasonable or unnecessary requirement on the public. \\n          Coast Guard personnel are encouraged to comment on \\n          rulemaking proposals.  Comments made in an official capacity \\n          should be submitted to the Executive Secretary, Marine \\n          Safety Council via G-LRA.  Both the unit and district \\n          commanders should include recommendations and additional \\n          information believed to be of benefit in their endorsements. \\n          Coast Guard personnel writing as private individuals should \\n          not submit their comments on Coast Guard stationery; \\n          however, it is not improper to identify oneself as a member \\n          of the Coast Guard.

Convening Authorities must ensure the \\nI/O has access to an interview space that is far removed from the work spaces of those involved to ensure that meetings are kept confidential and witnesses feel that they can speak freely.  The Convening Authority must also ensure that the reporting party, \\nalleged victims, and alleged perpetrators are not expected or tasked to provide logistical support for the investigation. \\nf. All parties associated with the complaint or ensuing investigation are provided the \\nopportunity to raise any concerns about the investigative process, in writing, with the convening authority.  Additionally, a military member who has concerns about the investigative process may submit an Article 138 complaint in accordance with the Military Justice Manual, COMDTINST M5810.1 (series). \\n7. Requirement for legal review: Prior to routing the completed investigative report to the \\nConvening Authority, the I/O must route it through the Servicing Legal Office for a legal sufficiency review. The Servicing Legal Office will be listed on the “Thru” line of the report. A signature endorsement on the report by the Servicing Legal Office signifies the report is legally sufficient.  The I/O must account for the time needed for legal review in order to ens ure that the deadline for completion is met. \\n8. Final Action .  The CO/OIC must take final action (i.e., at a minimum, make a formal \\nfinding whether the alleged conduct occurred) on every investigation.  \\na. The f inal action must be documented in writing and mus t be a stand -alone document.  \\nIt must provide relevant information such as the identity of the complainant and the \\nalleged perpetrator, contact dates, time, locations , allegations, the decision, and any \\nactions taken. \\nb. Prior to taking final action, the CO/OIC must consult with his/her staff judge advocate.  \\nThe CO/OIC’s finding may substantiate that prohibited harassment as defined in 3.D. \\nabove occurred. A finding of harassment by the CO/OIC through the AHHI process \\ndoes not substitute for the EEO process.  \\nc.

Conversely, if the CO/OIC determines that the behavior did not meet these standards, \\nthe allegation must be unsubstantiated. \\ne. Additionally: The CO/OIC must articulate, in a Final Action Memorandum, the basis \\nfor the determination of whether prohibited harassment occurred and the evidence reviewed to reach the determination (see sample memo in Appendix J) . \\n(1) In cases where the CO/OIC substantiates that prohibited harassment occurred, but \\ndoes not intend to take disciplinary action as a result, the CO must document in the Final Action Memo the rationale for not taking disciplinary actions.  “Disciplinary \\naction” includes punitive, non-punitive, and administrative action. \\n3-12 '}, vector=None),\n",

Authority Of The District Commander .  Under 33 CFR 100, the \\n      district commander may promulgate special local regulations for a \\n      regatta or marine parade.  These regulations may include \\n      restrictions and controls over vessel movement immediately \\n      before, during, and immediately after the event, and may also \\n      establish any aids to navigation necessary for the observance and \\n      enforcement of those special local regulations.  Guidance on \\n      establishing special local regulations is found in COMDTINST \\n      M16704.2 Series.  The district commander may detail Coast Guard \\n      vessels to patrol the course of a regatta or marine parade for \\n      the purpose of enforcing special local regulations, providing \\n      assistance, and enforcing laws in general.  Coast Guard Auxiliary \\n      and private vessels may be employed subject to the restrictions \\n      imposed in 33 CFR 100.40. Because of the number of marine events \\n      held annually and resource limitations, the use of Coast Guard \\n      vessels is limited to those events which may be expected to \\n      introduce extra or unusual hazards, or to impede the normal flow \\n      of marine traffic. \\n   \\n      a.  Concurrent Jurisdiction .  Where concurrent federal/state \\n          jurisdiction exists, the district commander is authorized \\n          under 33 CFR 100.10 to enter into agreements with state \\n          authorities to permit them to review applications and issue \\n          permits for certain events when it is clearly within the \\n          capabilities of the state to do so.  Such agreements are in \\n          keeping with the Commandant\\'s policy of encouraging the \\n          states to assume a greater role in boating safety, and are \\n          encouraged. \\n   \\n      b.  Establishment Of Temporary Aids To Navigation .  The district \\n          commander may establish temporary aids to navigation and \\n          authorize private aids to navigation to mark marine parades \\n          or regattas (see 33 CFR 100.45).     Such markers are not \\n          considered \"aids to navigation\" for the Coast Guard\\'s \\n          purposes, as long as the following conditions are met: \\n   \\n          (1)  They are established for a marine event of a specified \\n               and limited duration authorized by the Coast Guard and \\n               not for general navigational use; \\n   \\n          (2)  They are established to mark turning points, a slalom \\n               course, or other lanes of restriction to participants; \\n               and \\n   \\n          (3)  They do not display the characteristics prescribed for \\n               the lateral or Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) marker \\n               systems. \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                            1-31                              CH-3 '}, vector=None),\n",

Caution Against Fraudulent Applications.    \\nAn application not completed truthfully should be considered fraudulent, and any license or MMD initially issued under such an application should be voided ab initio (as if never issued; see Commandant Decision on Appeal 2025).  All applicants shall \\nbe advised of the penalties for making false statements on an application form (see 18 U.S.C. 1001).  Failure of the applicant to answer questions on the application may cause considerable delay in processing and issuing  the document, and the applicant \\nshall be so informed.  Items not applicable should be noted by \"N/A\" or \"None,\" as appropriate.  When a fraudulent application is discovered the applicant shall be \\nnotified that any initial document thereby issued is \"null and void\" and be directed to \\nimmediately return it to the OCMI.  A document that has been re -issued based on a \\nfraudulent application cannot be declared \"null and void.\"  In these cases the documented person must be charged and taken to a hearing.

The National Fire Protection Association \\n          developed NFPA 1405 at the request of, and in cooperation \\n          with, the United States Coast Guard and with the assistance \\n          of the fire service and maritime communities.  The Coast \\n          Guard provided representatives to the Subcommittee for Land- \\n          Based Fire Fighters Who Fight Marine Vessel Fires. \\n   \\n      b.  Purpose.  NFPA 1405 was developed for use by local fire \\n          fighting organizations that may be confronted with a fire \\n          aboard a vessel.  This publication identifies the elements \\n          required to formulate a comprehensive marine fire fighting \\n          response program.  NFPA 1405 discusses vessel \\n          familiarization, training, response techniques, contingency \\n          planning, and the hazards a fire fighter may face in \\n          combatting a vessel fire.  The guide also recommends \\n          practices to use in responding to fire in the maritime \\n          environment.  NFPA 1405 provides an excellent resource of \\n          information which will aid fire fighters to safely and \\n          efficiently extinguish a marine vessel fire. \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  8-31                        CH-4 '}, vector=None),\n",

Canada uses the term \\n              \"On-Scene Commander\" whereas the U.S. uses the term \\n              \"On-Scene Coordinator.\"  The appropriate Canadian Coast \\n              Guard regional director and the appropriate U.S. Coast Guard \\n              district commander each designate an OSC for the various \\n              regions.  The U.S. predesignates the OSC\\'s, whereas the \\n              Canadians designate individuals on a case-by-case basis. \\n              The determination as to which party will actually assign the \\n              OSC for a particular incident is dependent on the location \\n              of the spill (incident), and the relative threat that it \\n              poses to the U.S. and Canada.  The country that is most \\n              threatened by the spill (incident) assigns the OSC.  If the \\n               relative threat shifts to the other party, then the \\n              assignment of the OSC could switch.  The designated OSC that \\n              is not acting as OSC will serve as the Deputy OSC for the \\n              particular incident, and will serve as liaison and \\n              coordinate with the assigned OSC as appropriate. \\n          g.

COAST GUARD MARINE FIRE FIGHTING ACTIVITIES \\n     \\n    A. Authority . \\n     \\n       Among the provisions of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of \\n       1972 (PWSA) (33 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.) is an acknowledgment that \\n       increased supervision of port operations is necessary to prevent \\n       damage to structures in, on, or adjacent to the navigable waters \\n       of the U.S., and to reduce the possibility of vessel or cargo \\n       loss, or damage to life, property, and the marine environment. \\n       Section 4202 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Public \\n       Law 101-380) mandates that the Coast Guard maintain an Area \\n       Contingency Plan of pollution response equipment (including fire \\n       fighting equipment) within each port.  These statutes, along with \\n       the traditional functions and powers of the Coast Guard to render \\n       aid and save property (14 U.S.C. 88(b)), is the basis for Coast \\n       Guard fire fighting activities. 42 U.S.C. 1856-1856(d) provides \\n       that an agency charged with providing fire protection for any \\n       property of the United States may enter into reciprocal \\n       agreements with state and local fire fighting organizations to \\n       provide for mutual aid.  This statute further provides that \\n       emergency assistance may be rendered in the absence of a \\n       reciprocal agreement, when it is determined by the head of that \\n       agency to be in the best interest of the United States. \\n    B. Policy. \\n     \\n       The Coast Guard has traditionally provided fire fighting \\n       equipment and training to protect its vessels and property. \\n       Commanding Officers of Coast Guard units (COTP\\'s, Groups, \\n       Cutters, Stations) are routinely called upon to provide \\n       assistance at fires on board vessels and at waterfront \\n       facilities.  Although the Coast Guard clearly has an interest in \\n       fires involving vessels or waterfront facilities, local \\n       authorities are principally responsible for maintaining the \\n       necessary fire fighting capabilities within U.S. ports and \\n       harbors.  Additionally, a vessel/facility\\'s owner and/or operator \\n       is ultimately responsible for the overall safety of \\n       vessels/facilities under their control, including ensuring \\n       adequate fire fighting protection. \\n     \\n       The Coast Guard traditionally renders assistance as available, \\n       commensurate with each unit\\'s level of training and the adequacy \\n       of equipment.  The Commandant intends to maintain this \\n       traditional \"assistance as available\" posture without conveying \\n       the impression that the Coast Guard is prepared to relieve local \\n       fire departments of their responsibilities.  Paramount in \\n       preparing for vessel or waterfront fires is the need to integrate \\n       Coast Guard planning and training efforts with those of other \\n       responsible agencies, particularly local fire departments and \\n       port authorities. \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    8-1                      CH-4 '}, vector=None),\n",

Reference ( nn) provides the framework through which exercise programs and activities \\nof individual  response community members can be organized, coordinated, and guided.  Reference \\n(nn) describes procedures, standardizes terminology, and provides general guidance for planning, \\nexecuting, and evaluating contingency preparedness exercises.  Using referenc e (nn) , members of the \\nmaritime response community can achieve maximum benefit - individually and collectively - from \\nmaritime contingency response exercising.  The following provides an executive summary of \\ninformation on contingency exercise planning . Reference (nn)  shall be the primary reference . \\nThe exercise program is intended to involve the entire maritime response community across the \\ncountry and focuses on the need for a response community approach to maritime response exercising.  \\nSuch an approac h recognizes that the response to an actual maritime incident will be a community \\neffort, that is, it will involve personnel, resources and plans of several organizations and agencies in \\naddition to the Coast Guard.  The number of organizations will depend  on the size, location, and \\ncircumstances of the incident.  \\nAn organization participates in the Exercise Program when it recognizes the Program's guidance in \\nplanning, conducting, and evaluating its maritime response exercise activities.  Participation invo lves \\nupholding program principles and fulfilling the responsibility of response community members.  \\nThe Exercise Program's success will be determined by the quality, consistency, coordination and \\nfrequency of maritime response exercises.  It will also be de termined by the tangible contributions \\nmade to the four goals of this program:  planning, training, response techniques , and exercising.  \\n \\nF.4.1  Guiding Principles  \\nThe following are guiding principles that provide the foundation of the Exercise Program.  \\nF.4.1.1 Community approach to exercising .  Maritime response exercising aims to incorporate the \\nsame cooperative management approach between response community members that would \\noccur during response to a real emergency.  The targeted levels of preparedness and \\nexercising (e.g., type and frequency) are established jointly or by the community as a whole.  \\nOnce determined, members work cooperatively to achieve them.  Exercises are scheduled to \\nmaximize the frequency and degree of community involvement.  Finally , exercise costs are \\nshared fairly and equitably among the various community members.  \\nF.4.1.2  Progressive development of response preparedness .  The Response Community's \\npreparedness is built progressively through simple, discrete exercises that are clearl y focused \\non a limited number of measurable, achievable objectives.  Starting with task -oriented \\noperational exercises  and then moving on to functional and combined functional \\nmanagement exercises, the community develops its response capability and exercis e \\nexperience levels in a gradual, logical fashion.  \\nF.4.1.3  Identifying and sharing exercise lessons learned .  All maritime response exercises are \\nthoroughly evaluated and the lessons learned from them documented and appropriately acted \\non by participants.

If a basket is used, the patient should sit in the bottom of the \\nbasket, with their back to one end and must keep their arms and legs inside the basket until the basket \\nis brought inside the helicopter.  The patient should have appropriate personal identification such as a \\ndriver’s license, social security card, or passport and immunization record, a record of any \\nmedication(s) administered, and a modest supply of personal items, including any prescribed \\nmedications they may be taking regularly.  Use of a small soft -type bag is recommended for packing \\nthese items.  It should be tied to the litter between the patient’s legs, or placed in the basket with the \\npatient.

Command -Level Community Engagement.  Coast Guard units at all levels achieve \\ncommunity relations objectives by creating and maintaining relationships within their \\ncommunities and with regional and local stakeholder s. Units at all levels are encouraged \\nto actively participate in the community, and decisions on whether to support or host \\nevents or activities should be made in alignment with the command’s communication \\ngoals. The following events are examples of observ ances and events that are generally \\nsuitable for support.  \\na.  Federal Holiday Observances.  All units are encouraged to participate in local \\nevents in recognition of federal holidays and observances. Some examples of \\nthese holidays include Memorial Day, Indepe ndence Day , POW -MIA Day, and \\nVeterans Day.  \\nb. Coast Guard Day.  Coast Guard Day, August 4th, is both an internal activity for \\nCoast Guard personnel and an opportunity to educate and engage local \\ncommunities, service organizations, and media on the Service’s r ich history and \\ncontributions to the community.

Commandant (CG -09232), working with the \\nDepartmen t of Defense Director of Community Relations, has overall \\nresponsibility for national -level coordination, including designating regional \\nArmed Forces Day sites. District commanders and commanding officers of \\nHeadquarters units are responsible for coordinat ing Armed Forces Day programs \\nin their areas of responsibility.  \\nd. Ceremonies.  Commands may participate in civil ceremonies, inaugurals, \\ndedications of public buildings and projects, ceremonies for official visitors, and \\nthe convening of legislative bodies.  \\ne.  Free Public Events.  The Coast Guard may participate in patriotic programs, \\nnational holiday celebrations, and events open to the public with no charge for \\nadmission. The Coast Guard can be a major attraction or a lesser participant in \\nsuch events.  \\nf. Commerc ial Events under Certain Conditions.  The Coast Guard may participate \\nin events that charge for admission; however, the public must not be specifically \\ncharged to observe the Coast Guard’s participation. For example, a color guard \\nappearance at a profession al football game is incidental to the event; it is not \\ndesigned as a drawing factor for the game and does not add to the cost for \\nspectators.

Planning For Natural Disaster Response .  In general, COTP\\'s shall consult \\n          CG-368-2.  A \"natural disaster\" is an occurrence or imminent threat of \\n          widespread or severe damage, injury, or loss of life or property resulting \\n          from any natural cause, including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, wind or \\n          wave action, volcanic activity, epidemic, contamination, blight, drought, \\n          or infestation.  The primary responsibility for disaster response rests at \\n          the local and state levels.  Federal assistance may be provided when local \\n          and state governments are unable to cope with the effects of the disaster; \\n          authorities frequently request Coast Guard assistance in such cases as \\n          severe port and waterfront damage caused by coastal storms. \\n  \\n      6.

See volume VII (TO BE DEVELOPED) of \\n          this manual for further information on recovery and reporting of foreign \\n          materiel. \\n \\n  C.  Port Emergency Planning .  [NOTE:  For further information, see volume VII (TO \\n      BE DEVELOPED) of this manual.]  Under Executive Order (E.O.) 11490, as amended \\n      by E.O. 11921, broad emergency preparedness functions have been assigned to \\n      the Maritime Administration (MARAD).  The functions for which MARAD is \\n      responsible fall into two distinct phases:  Phase 1 concerns peacetime \\n      planning for operation of U.S. seaports under emergency conditions; Phase 2 \\n      implements these plans upon the declaration of a national emergency.  To \\n      ensure coordination of MARAD programs concerning port utilization and control \\n      with Coast Guard responsibilities as delineated by E.O. 10173, direct liaison \\n      is maintained between Commandant (G-OIS) and (G-WPE), and MARAD\\'s Office of \\n      Port and Intermodal Development.  Commandant (G-WPE) has been designated as \\n      Coast Guard liaison for port utilization and control and questions concerning \\n      subject should be referred to them.  In February 1959, MARAD requested 100 \\n      port authorities on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts to initiate \\n      preparedness planning for their ports.  Since that time, similar requests have \\n      been made concerning selected ports of the Great Lakes, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto \\n      Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  The basic premise of a port preparedness \\n      program is that local authorities can best determine their own emergency needs \\n      and develop detailed methods of meeting those needs with available resources. \\n      MARAD provides fundamental guidance and coordinates the efforts of neighboring \\n      ports having common interests. \\n  \\n      1.  Port Planning Committees . \\n  \\n          a.  Planning Features .  At the local level, actual port emergency \\n              operations plans are developed by port planning committees.  The \\n              committee members are usually appointed by the local port authority or \\n              port industry, under a \"delegation\" of responsibility from MARAD. \\n              Each committee prepares a plan with universal planning base features. \\n              These include: \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                     6-13 '}, vector=None),\n",

Embed requests must \\nbe coordinated through the embed coordinator at the appropriate combatant command \\nor major command. Follow DoD public affairs poli cy, or specific combatant \\ncommand public affairs policy, when deployed in support of DoD operations.  \\n \\n6. Non-Military Incidents.  A non -military incident is a situation, which could adversely \\naffect U.S. foreign relations or the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.  Non-military \\nincidents include hijackings, asylum requests, the seizure of or interference with the \\nnavigation of a U.S. -flagged ship, the detainment or harassment of a U.S. citizen \\nabroad, conflicts between U.S. and foreign fishing vessels, and law enfor cement \\nactions taken against a foreign -flagged ship.

Non-Categorized Contingency or Accident.  A non -categorized contingency or \\naccident is a situation that could potentially have been caused by and cannot clearly \\nbe discounted as a terrorist attack. In t hese incidents, timely, authoritative, and \\nconsistent information is vital to public safety and confidence. Statements, press \\nreleases, web/social media postings, and imagery releases must be clearly and \\ncarefully conveyed to promote public safety, protect  future courses of action \\n(including investigations), and not stoke speculation. Coast Guard spokespeople will \\nnot speculate as to the cause of an incident. Any further statements, to include \\ndetermining a terrorist incident, will be referred to the approp riate lead agency if \\nidentified. Further statements must first be coordinated with other relevant authorities \\nat the local and national levels. Coordination at the  national level is through the \\nNational Joint Information C enter via Commandant (CG -0922).

Three & \\nSix Minute RulesThe safe navigation of some waterways (i.e. restrictive waters) requires the \\nprudent mariner to fix the vessel’s position much more often than what would \\nbe required in open waters.  Even though transit speeds in these waters are \\ngreatly reduced, it is still possible to rapidly move into danger if fix intervals \\nare too far apart.     \\nThe three and six minute rules are tools frequently used during piloting \\nnavigation to quickly determine distance or speed.  \\nDepending on which rule is used, both are based on two known values, time \\nin minutes (3 or 6) and distance in yards or nautical miles.\\nF.12.a. Three \\nMinute Rule Yards traveled, in 3 minutes, Divided by 100, equals Speed\\n      and, conversely,\\nSpeed, in 3 minutes, Multiplied by 100, equals Yards traveled.\\nF.12.a.1.\\nExample – Three \\nMinute Rule A vessel traveling at a speed of one (1) knot would cover one (1) nautical mile \\nin one (1) hour.  So, to start with, let’s change the time to just one minute and \\nsee how far the vessel will go (still at 1 knot).  \\nSince one nautical mile in navigation equals 2000 yards, and one hour is 60 \\nminutes, we can surmise that the vessel would travel 33.333 yards for every \\nminute (at 1 knot).   (e.g. 2000 ÷ 60 = 33.333 yards per minute).\\nKnowing that the vessel will travel 33.333 yards per minute is not much help \\nuntil we note that three ( 3 min.) times that number equals 99.999 yards which \\nis extremely close to the number 100, and that number is quickly and easily \\ncalculated in math formulas.  Therefore, for every knot of speed, in 3 minutes, \\nyou will travel 100 yards (see examples in F.12.a.2. Find Speed below).  \\nNOTE \\nF.12.a.2.

Wave \\nSystems After the deepwater waves are generated far out at sea, they move outward, \\naway from their wind source, in ever-increasing curves, and become what are \\ncalled swells.  The farther the swell moves from its source, the more uniform \\nits characteristics become, as it travels in a series of waves, relatively \\nequidistant, and moving at a more or less constant speed.  Because of this, \\nswells generated from storms far out at sea can be distinguished by their \\nsmoothness and uniformity from those that are coarser (peaked and irregular) \\nwhich have recently originated nearby.  The usual period of these swells is \\nfrom 6 to 10 seconds.  This corresponds with wave lengths of 184 to 1310 feet \\nand velocities of 18 to 49 knots.  \\nInterference between different swell systems, which are traveling in nearly the \\nsame direction, causes groups of waves to travel outward in patches.  As these \\ngroups of several waves (normally 7 to 12) progress outward, those waves in \\nthe forefront disappear and new waves, of the same characteristics, appear at \\nthe rear of the patch.  This process continues until the waves dissipate their \\nenergy at sea, or transfer it to the shore as surf.  \\nThe ability to recognize wave patterns and characteristics is essential to safe \\noperation in surf and heavy weather.

A response strategy cannot be formulated before \\n          issues of toxicity, volatility, and reactivity (especially to \\n          water and other fire fighting agents) are resolved.

In some instances, it may be prudent to employ \\n          the available fixed systems rather than risk the safety of \\n          responders in a direct attack upon the fire.  The Incident \\n          Commander must also evaluate the necessity to evacuate the \\n          scene and surrounding area due to the existence or potential \\n          threat of plume development. \\n   \\n  3.  Passenger Vessels . \\n   \\n      a.  Introduction .  Fire fighting operations on passenger vessels \\n          can be extremely difficult.  Public and accommodation spaces \\n          on passenger vessels will often present a higher fire load \\n          than other vessels because of the quantity of synthetic \\n          materials used to enhance the vessel's appearance.  Another \\n          result of these cosmetic enhancements will be the existence \\n          of many void spaces and probably a complex ventilation system \\n          which will contribute to the spread of fire and smoke.  Large \\n          passenger vessels, such as cruise ships, are constructed with \\n          a large number of small compartments connected by narrow \\n          passageways and ladders.  The layout of many of these vessels \\n          all but ensures that the Incident Commander, even with the \\n          benefit of pre-fire planning, will be faced with manpower \\n          shortages as fire fighters become fatigued and air supplies \\n          are exhausted in efforts to locate and extract victims, and \\n          then access and extinguish the fire. \\n   \\n      b.  Special Planning .  The COTP's shall work with the passenger \\n          vessel industry, the port authority, and local response and \\n          relief agencies operating in their respective zones or AOR's \\n          to ensure the coordination of these parties for the \\n          evacuation of and accountability for the vessel's passengers \\n          in the event of fire or other emergency.  An accurate \\n          account of persons both ashore and aboard the vessel is \\n          critical in expediting the pace and aiding to ensure \\n          successful fire fighting and rescue operations.  The sooner \\n          search and rescue is completed the sooner efforts can be \\n          focused upon property conservation.  The displacement of up \\n          to several hundred passengers will require pre-planning for \\n          lodging, medical attention, meals, transportation, and \\n          communications.  While these factors are principally the \\n          concern of the industry, the COTP has a vested interest in \\n          ensuring these factors have been addressed within the port. \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  8-29                        CH-4 \"}, vector=None),\n",

Facility damage and personnel injury  \\n   from the explosion of mass detonating explosive materials,   \\n   class/division 1.1, results primarily from blast overpressure and  \\n   impulse.  For Quantity-Distance (Q-D) determinations, peak incident  \\n   overpressure generally is the parameter used to define maximum   \\n   permissible levels of exposure.      \\n            \\n   The violent release of energy from a detonation in a medium such as  \\n   air or water creates a sudden increase in pressure within that   \\n  \\n   medium.  The resulting pressure disturbance, or blast wave, is   \\n   characterized by an almost instantaneous rise from the ambient   \\n   pressure to a peak incident pressure.  This pressure increase, or  \\n   shock front, travels outward from the detonation point with a   \\n   diminishing velocity, but one that always exceeds the sonic velocity  \\n   of the medium.  As the shock front expands into increasingly larger  \\n   volumes of the medium, the peak incident pressure at the shock front  \\n   decreases and the duration of the pressure increases.    \\n  \\n   Separation distance requirements for explosives are based on the  \\n   degree of protection needed and amount of explosive material   \\n   involved.  When making Q-D determinations involving explosives,  \\n   distance is calculated using the formula:     \\n            \\n                               D = KW 1/3    \\n            \\n   where D is the separation distance in feet, K is a safety factor  \\n   depending on the risk assumed or permitted.  In accordance with DOD  \\n   standards, the Coast Guard established risk factor is 40 (K=40),  \\n   except in cases involving more than 250,000 lbs of explosives (where  \\n   K=50).  W is the net explosive weight (NEW) in pounds of ALL  \\n   explosives on board the vessel or vessels and the waterfront  \\n   facility.  When determining Q-D requirements for explosives use the  \\n   Q-D tables provided (figure 6-1-1) or the Ammunition and Explosive  \\n   Safety Standards, DOD 6055.9-STD and Ammunition and Explosives   \\n   Ashore Safety Regulations for Handling, Storing, Production,   \\n   Renovation and Shipping, NAVSEA OP 5, Volume 1.    \\n            \\n   The Coast Guard approach is additive when calculating NEW, the total \\n   NEW of ALL explosives present must be taken into account.  Although \\n   there may be and often is more than one class/division of explosive  \\n   on board a vessel or at a water front facility (i.e., class 1.1,  \\n   1.2, 1.5, etc.), the Coast Guard takes a conservative position that  \\n   all explosives present will be considered class/division 1.1 if any  \\n   explosives present are class/division 1.1 when calculating the NEW  \\n   for Q-D purposes.        \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n                                  6-1-1 '}, vector=None),\n",

If the company’s proposal is determined to be insufficient, the OCMI should respond \\nproviding justification and outline manning levels that are conside red acceptable.  This  \\nmay include requesting an amended minimum safe manning proposal.  \\n \\n3. The OCMI should only approve a proposal for the minimum safe manning of a  vessel and issue a COI or SMD/SML if he/she is fully satisfied that the proposed vessel's complement is established in accordance with the principles, recommendations and \\nguidelines contained herein, and is adequate in all respects for the safe operation and security of the vessel and for the protection of the marine environment.  The established  \\nmanning level must not be less than the minimums stipulated by law or regulation.  The proposal and resulting determination should be thoroughly documented in MISLE.   \\n \\n4. Unless expressly provided for under law or regulation, the OCMI should consider the circumstances very carefully before allowing a COI or SMD/SML to contain provisions  \\nfor less than three qualified officers in charge of a navigational watch, while taking into account all the principles for establishing safe manning as applicable.

U.S. Coast Guard Oversight.   (2014, 2017 ) \\nDuring inspection activities, Coast Guard personnel shall veri fy compliance with the manning \\nlevel specified on the COI, or SMD/SML, as well as with any other applicable manning regulations.  This should include a review of credentials and the crew list to ensure authenticity, validity, and service within any endorse ment restrictions.  Coast Guard personnel \\nshould be mindful that an MMC authorizes the holder to serve in any capacity endorsed thereon, or in any lower capacity in the same department, or in any capacity covered by a general endorsement with respect to gr ade, propulsion mode, propulsion power, tonnage, route, \\nand special limitations/waivers.  Evidence that the vessel or its crew does not correspond with the relevant requirements or that the vessel is otherwise being operated in such a manner as to pose a d anger to persons, property or the environment may lead to clear grounds for a more \\ndetailed/expanded inspection and/or audit of the safety management system (if applicable).

Often it will be necessary to make assumptions about the \\ntype of search object based on the sighti ng report, local knowledge of typical craft and activities \\nin the area, and correlation with other concurrent incidents, overdues, etc.  If the difference \\nbetween the time of the sighting and the SRU’s time of arrival on scene  is short, and the search \\nobject’s drift is likely to be slow, then the  rectangle enclosing the  datum area may also be used \\nas the  initial response  search area.  The search planner may then proceed with the remainder \\nof the search planning and execution process.  However, in areas of h igh drift rates , when there \\nwill be a significant delay in the SRU’s arrival on scene , or a second (e.g., first light) search is \\nplanned, the search planner may need to compute a new datum area for the SRU’s projected \\narrival time that accounts for search object drift.    \\nThis may be accomplished manually by drifting each corner of the datum area as if it were an \\ninitial point datum.  Assume the initial position error (X) for each corner point is zero.  This \\nwill often result  in twice as many datums  (8) as corner points  (4) due to leeway divergence.  \\nWhen using the manual search planning method, draw a probable error circle around each \\ndatum and enclose the entire set of circles in a rectangle to obtain the search area.  In the event \\na corner point of the ini tial datum area falls on shore and it is virtually certain that the flare \\noriginated from a position on the water, choose initial datum points  that are close  to the corner \\npoints but in the water.   \\n1.5.3.1  Searching the Original Datum Area.   In situations where the original datum area is not \\nincluded in the search area following drift, consideration should be given to searching the \\noriginal area if the search object may have been anchored.  \\n1.5.3.2  SAROPS/SAR Tools Preferred.   Using SAROPS/SA R Tools’ full capabilities is the \\npreferred method for planning a search, including the initial response search.  However, if a \\nsearch pattern is established without using the SAROPS Simulator and planner, the pattern \\nmay be imported later for evaluation b y the SAROPS Simulator.  The next section describes \\nplanning searches using SAR Tools both without and with using SAROP Simulator and \\nPlanner.  \\n '}, vector=None),\n",

DOD Q-D  \\n   standards are based on historical data collected and analyzed   \\n   through studies and observations of explosive incidents, both   \\n   military and commercial.  DOD 6055.9-STD has incorporated   \\n   fragmentation hazard (\"missile hazard\") into Q-D calculations for  \\n   safe separation distances.  Since certain types of military   \\n   explosive assemblies have a greater fragmentation hazard than   \\n   others, individual Q-D tables are established for various explosive  \\n   hazard divisions.  Exceptions for specific explosive items that have  \\n   received extensive evaluation, and for which a different minimum  \\n   distance is provided, are identified in DOD 6055.9-STD. In general,  \\n   we do not believe that military explosives are more sensitive or  \\n   less stable than commercial explosives.  C-4 is C-4 regardless who  \\n   ships it.         \\n            \\n   The exposed site (ES), or the potential hazard area surrounding  \\n   explosives, increases in size as the quantity of explosives at any  \\n   one location increase.  For this reason.- it is desirable to keep  \\n   the quantity of explosives present in one location to the minimum  \\n   amount that is consistent with operating requirements and maximum  \\n   utilization of land.  The distance separating the potential   \\n   explosion site (PES), from the ES, determines the permissible amount  \\n   of explosives permitted to be safely loaded/unloaded from vessels in  \\n   the close proximity to Inhabited Buildings (IBD), public traffic  \\n   routes (PTR) and other sensitive areas.     \\n            \\n   Public traffic route distance is the distance separating a PES from  \\n   a public highway, navigable waterway, passenger railway or other  \\n   traffic route used by the public.  Unless access is clearly limited;  \\n   e.g., by unsuitable terrain or travel not open to the public because  \\n   it is government-owned; public traffic route distances apply to all  \\n   roads outside of a government installation boundary.  Public traffic  \\n   route distances also apply to most passenger vehicle parking areas  \\n   and to open recreational areas that do not include bleacher stands  \\n   or other places where large numbers of personnel may be present.  \\n            \\n   Inhabited building distance is the distance between a PES and any  \\n   structure, except explosive operations buildings, where persons  \\n   live, work or assemble.  Inhabited building distances apply to all  \\n   areas beginning at the installation boundary.     \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                  6-1-2 '}, vector=None),\n",

Electronic  Chart Data Scaling . \\n \\na. Viewing . Electronic chart data is most accurate when displayed at its source scale.  \\nScaling/zooming in, or out, distorts the visually perceived relative distance between chart objects. \\nHowever, some systems display an overscale pattern if outside its source scale.

Display matching ensures d isplayed information is consistently oriented to the \\nviewer, thereby preventing errors in interpretation.  \\n \\n(1) When  the system displays radar and electronic chart data together in overlay mode, the \\ndisplay must match in scale, orientation, and projection.

Generally, Coast Guard electronic navigation systems have three alarm levels \\nas described below. For units with eNav systems that do not use this three -alarm hierarchy, \\nensure operators know the corresponding alarm levels and functions for the eNav syste m in use.  \\n \\n(1) Danger . The system produces a continuous audible alarm and flashes red. Danger alarms alert \\nthe user to issues that require immediate attention.  \\n \\n(2) Warning . The system produces a brief audible alarm and flashes yellow. Warning alarms \\nalert the use r to issues that, if left uncorrected, could compromise navigational safety.  \\n \\n(3) Caution . The system flashes yellow. Caution alarms are normally advisory.  \\n \\nb. Chart Objects . Users can select specific chart objects (e.g., Aids to Navigation (ATON), \\nCautionary Areas, Land) and assign a specific alarm level based on distance to the object and \\nother factors.  \\n \\nc.

In search and rescue, the SMC is usually in the best position to \\nassess the circumstances of a particular case, and to take whatever steps are necessary to \\npromote the safety of life and property.  \\n \\n4.1.4.4 Safety Concerns When Disabled.  Inherent danger is associated with being disabled on the \\nwater.  Although a specific situation may not be classified as DISTRESS emergency phase \\nby the SMC, there may still be a real concern for safety either in the mind of the SMC or the \\nmariner , i.e., the incident is in  the ALERT emergency phase.  The SMC must be sensitive to \\nthe level of apprehension caused in the mind of the mariner when having a problem in a \\nsmall recreational vessel, particularly when concern is specifically expressed . The policy \\nherein permits more expeditious response in those cases where the mariner expresses \\napprehension for the near -term safety of vessel’s  occupants.  \\n \\n4.1.5 Policy  \\n \\n4.1.5.1 Distress .  Immediate response shall  be initiated, if feasible, to any known situation in which \\nthe mariner i s in imminent danger. This response may be provided by regular Coast Guard; \\nCoast Guard Auxiliary; or other federal, private, state, local, or commercial entity resources.  \\nThe SMC may use all sources of assistance in a distress situation without concern f or conflict \\nwith private enterprise.  \\n \\n4.1.5.2 No Conflict Concern --Any Situation.  Private organizations (non -commercial), state and \\nlocal organizations, and Good Samaritans are acceptable sources of SAR assistance.  When \\nvolunteered or available, their he lp can be used without any concern for conflict with \\ncommercial providers.  However, if their expertise is unknown, the SMC shall more closely \\nmonitor the assistance provided.   This is especially true in the case of Good Samaritans.  \\n \\n4.1.5.3 Guiding Princi ples in Non -Distress Cases.  When specifically requested assistance, such as \\na commercial firm, marina, or friend, is not available, a request for assistance will be \\nbroadcasted.  If a commercial provider is available and can be on scene within a reasonabl e \\ntime (usually one hour or less) or an offer to assist is made by a responder listed in the previous \\nparagraph, no further action by the Coast Guard, beyond monitoring the incident, will be \\ntaken.  Otherwise, a Coast Guard Auxiliary facility, if available , or a Coast Guard resource \\nmay be used.  \\n \\nNOTE: “Monitoring” of a non -distress incident need not necessarily constitute a radio \\ncommunications schedule.  \\n \\nThree principles that guide assistance to vessels not in distress are:  \\n \\n(a) The first responder on scene w ith the vessel requesting assistance normally will provide \\nassistance,  \\n(b) If a Coast Guard resource or Auxiliary facility takes a disabled vessel in tow, the tow will \\nnormally terminate at the nearest safe haven, and  \\n(c) Once undertaken, there is no requirement to break the tow except as described below in \\nParagraph 4.1.6.6, “Relief of Tow”.

It may be used in areas specifically \\n              approved by Commandant (G-ECV) in accordance with Code 10 of \\n              the NFPA. \\n \\n          [NOTE:  Vaporizing and halogenated extinguishers are considered \\n          toxic to personnel and not approved for general Coast Guard use. \\n          Soda acid extinguishers are considered inferior to other types \\n          and are not longer recommended for procurement.] \\n \\n      3.  Use Of Firefighting Pumps . \\n \\n          a.  P-60.  This is a rotary pump that delivers 60 gallons per \\n              minute (GPM) at 100 pounds per square inch (PSI).  As it \\n              cannot deliver a standard fire stream of 250 GPM at 50 PSI \\n              (through a 2-1/2\" hose), it is of very limited use.  [NOTE: \\n              The P-60 pump is being phased out of service.] \\n \\n          b.  PE-250.  This is a centrifugal pump that delivers 250 GPM \\n              at 100 PSI; it can be used to augment existing water \\n              supplies.  [NOTE:  This will soon be replaced by the P-250 \\n              Mod 1 pump.] \\n \\n          c.  Chrysler-Hale Trailer Pump .  This centrifugal pump \\n              delivers over 500 GPM at 100-200 PSI, and is the most \\n              effective Coast Guard maintained pump for firefighting \\n              purposes. \\n \\n      4.  Use Of Hoses And Nozzles .  Units having a need for firehoses \\n          should have both 2-1/2\" and 1-1/2\" firehoses.  Unlined linen \\n          hoses are extremely water wasteful and subject to quicker decay \\n          from mildew.  Rubber-lined 100 percent polyester hoses should be \\n          used wherever practicable and procured in all new purchases. \\n          Adjustable pattern, constant flow/shut-off brass nozzles are \\n          recommended.  These nozzles should be specified in all new \\n          purchases, and shall replace existing nozzles. \\n \\n  F.  Pollution Control Equipment .  The Commander\\'s policy is to \\n      initiate rapid and effective response to control discharges of oil \\n      and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants \\n      into U.S. waters or the environment, as specified in the Federal \\n      Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) as amended, and the \\n      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability \\n      Act of 1980 (CERCLA).  As one of the primary agencies responsible \\n      for pollution control, the Coast Guard has purchased equipment for \\n      use in the overall response to pollution incidents.  For maximum \\n      flexibility and effectiveness this equipment has been distributed to \\n      the National Strike Force (NSF), major ports, and units having \\n      access only to limited commercial response resources. \\n \\n      1.  District Responsibility .  Administrative responsibility and \\n          accountability for pollution control equipment normally rests \\n          with the district commander, who may delegate active management \\n          authority to individual units.  The district commander shall: \\n \\n          a.  Advise Commandant (G-WER) and (G-ECV) of new equipment \\n              purchases or relocation of existing response equipment; \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 8-13 '}, vector=None),\n",

[NOTE:  Action taken by a state or municipality, or a \\n      federal agency other than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \\n      under Section 311(b)(6)(B) of the FWPCA, does not not obviate the \\n      requirement for appropriate coast Guard civil penalty action.] \\n \\n      1.  Discharge Investigations .  While it is not explicity stated \\n          that the Coast Guard must conduct an investigation to assess a \\n          penalty under Section 311(b)(6), investigation is obviously \\n          necessary to develop evidence proving the elements of the \\n          offense.  It is also necessary to obtain corollary information \\n          (e.g., the gravity of the offense) which may be considered in \\n           assessing a penalty. \\n          a.  Coast Guard Responsibility .  In the absence or specific \\n              legal requirements to the contrary, an implicit \\n              responsibility to investigate discharges rests on the Coast \\n              Guard.  Agreements should be made among Coast Guard district \\n              commanders, EPA regional administrators, and state \\n              authorities to distribute investigative burdens; the \\n              predesignated on-scene coordinator\\'s (OSC\\'s) limits of \\n              authority should be specified in these agreements, where \\n              practicable.  These agreements should outline the minimal \\n              information to be included in the investigative report. \\n \\n          b.  Outside Assistance .  The Commandant recognizes that \\n              personnel and budgetary constraints may preclude the \\n              investigation of every reported discharge by Coast Guard \\n              personnel.  Assistance from outside resources, such as state \\n              agencies, is encouraged in such circumstances for timely \\n              response.  In certain instances, the EPA may be requested to \\n              forward a \"Section 308 letter\" to the suspented violator to \\n              supplement or aid an investigation.  The answers to the \\n              questions in this letter may furnish information, not \\n              otherwise obtainable, to support the assessment of a civil \\n              penalty action. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 5-10 '}, vector=None),\n",

(cont\\'d) navigation play a great part in marine safety, it is important \\n          for these officers to maintain contact with the district ATON branch; \\n          likewise, they should be apprised of changes in aids within their zones. \\n          Marine safety personnel frequently receive comments and suggestions about \\n          aids to navigation from mariners; these comments should be forwarded to \\n          the district ATON branch.  The COTP, OCMI and VTS should encourage their \\n          personnel to transit the area, whenever practicable.  This provides \\n          insight into the ATON system and familiarity with the area. \\n  \\n      4.  Reported ATON Discrepancies .  Due to the close association with marine \\n          interests, the OCMI, COTP or VTS will occasionally receive reports of ATON \\n          discrepancies.  Such reports should note, as a minimum, how far and in \\n          what direction buoys may be off-station; what components on buoys or \\n          structures have been damaged; what signals or features are improper or \\n          inoperative, and what is the current signal or status; the suspected cause \\n          of the malfunction or improper stationing of the buoy; on-scene weather \\n          conditions; hazardous conditions created; the name of the person or vessel \\n          reporting; and the identity (if known) of the party causing the damage. \\n          This information should be immediately relayed to the district ATON \\n          branch.  Since certain aids are more critical than others, immediate \\n          action cannot be taken to correct all discrepancies.  However, they must \\n          be recorded so that appropriate response will occur. \\n  \\n  C.  Navigation Rules .  The regulations, formerly referred to as the \"Rules of the \\n      Road,\" have the primary purpose of preventing collisions between vessels. \\n      Under authority of the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. \\n      151-221 and 2001 et seq., as amended), the old Inland, Western River, and \\n      Great Lakes Rules were combined into the new unified Inland Navigation Rules. \\n      These rules became effective on 24 December 1981 with the exception of the \\n      Great Lakes, which became effective on 1 March 1983.  The Inland and \\n      International Rules have been reprinted in COMDTINST M16672.2 (Series). \\n      Enforcement authority for these rules is vested in the Coast Guard.  With \\n      respect to the International Rules, enforcement authority is currently limited \\n      to actions pursuant to Section 4450, Revised Statutes of the United States (46 \\n      U.S.C. Chapter 77).  The Navigation Rules, combined with aids to navigation, \\n      constitute the most basic form of traffic management.  No vessel traffic \\n      management system relieves shipboard personnel from compliance with these \\n      Navigation Rules. \\n  \\n  D.  Voice Communications . \\n  \\n      1.  Vessel Bridge-To-Bridge Radiotelephone Act .  The purpose of the Act (33 \\n      U.S.C. 1201 et seq.) is to provide a positive means whereby operators of \\n      approaching vessels can communicate their intentions to one another. \\n      Regulations for the enforcement of this Act and for the use of vessel \\n      radiotelephones are contained in 33 CFR 26.  Information for vessels \\n      operating on the Great Lakes is found in the Agreement Between the United \\n      States of America and Canada for Promotion of Safety on the Great Lakes by \\n      Means of Radio, 1973, as amended in 1978.  Regulations which specify \\n      operating and technical conditions and characteristics, frequencies, and \\n      the power of radiotelephone equipment required under the law are described \\n      by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 47 CFR 81 and 83. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                     4-3 '}, vector=None),\n",

Per REF (A), 81% of boating fatalities were drownings, and 83%of those were victims that were not wearing life jackets. Pleaseencourage and incentivize life jacket wear (2022 statisticswill be released in June). Just like seatbelt wear, you never knowwhen you will need it, but when you do, it's critical. Most statesrequire life jacket wear by children. For adults, an inflatable lifejacket is not cumbersome and easy to don.

The certificates of inspection for such vessels still require licensed engineers to be on board (the engineer being on call as needed).  Since the engineers are on call, such service shall be treated as though t he license holder \\nwere in charge of a watch and will be creditable for a raise in grade\"\n",
